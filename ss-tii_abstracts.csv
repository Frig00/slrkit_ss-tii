0	Optimized control of price-based demand response with electric storage space heating	The increased uncertainty of the electric grid due to the penetration of renewable energy sources and deregulation of the electric market is aimed to be alleviated by demand response (DR) in the future smart grid. The demand-side resources can be incentivized to alter their consumption patterns by varying their electricity price over time. A major residential energy demand contribution is from electric heating, which, when combined with smart energy storage using water heaters, could be utilized to defer consumption to more inexpensive periods without affecting the customer's thermal quality of service. The objective is to optimize the consumer electricity price of electric storage space heating customers, in order to maximize the profit of the retailer. This approach of varying the customer electricity prices leads to a game-theoretic scenario, where the procurement and consumption profiles of the retailer and consumer agents are based on the set electricity price. The optimization of the consumer electricity price is shown to offer lesser expense for the retailer. In addition, hourly load-following can be improved by offering further discounts for the consumers. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	68
1	A model for wind turbines placement within a distribution network acquisition market	This paper proposes an innovative exhaustive search method for the optimal placement of wind turbines (WTs) in electrical distribution systems taking into account wind speed and load demand uncertainty, and the variability of electrical energy prices within a distribution network operator (DNO) acquisition market environment. The method combines Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and market-based optimal power flow (OPF) to maximize the net present value (NPV) related to the investment made by WTs' developers over a planning horizon. In particular, the MCS data feed the market-based OPF problem with inter-temporal constraints in order to find the most convenient WTs allocation and priority on the network, based on distribution-locational marginal prices (D-LMPs) in a competitive electricity market. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with an 84-bus 11.4-kV radial distribution system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	30
2	A self-organizing architecture for decentralized smart microgrids synchronization, control, and monitoring	The concept of smart microgrid (SMG) is widely recognized as one of the most promising and enabling technologies for smart grids. In this context, the development of integrated and decentralized frameworks for executing complex control and monitoring applications is still in its infancy and needs to be researched. To address this issue, this paper conceptualizes a self-organizing computing framework, based on self-organizing agents, for solving the fundamental control and monitoring problems of an SMG without the need for centralized data acquisition and processing. Simulation results obtained for an 18-bus test network are presented and discussed in order to demonstrate the significance and validity of the proposed new framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	71
3	Heuristic-based shiftable loads optimal management in smart micro-grids	In this paper, an optimal power dispatch problem on a 24-h basis for distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DER) also including directly controlled shiftable loads is presented. In the literature, the optimal energy management problems in smart grids (SGs) where such types of loads exist are formulated using integer or mixed integer variables. In this paper, a new formulation of shiftable loads is employed. Such formulation allows reduction in the number of optimization variables and the adoption of real valued optimization methods such as the one proposed in this paper. The method applied is a novel nature-inspired multiobjective optimization algorithm based on an original extension of a glowworm swarm particles optimization algorithm, with algorithmic enhancements to treat multiple objective formulations. The performance of the algorithm is compared to the NSGA-II on the considered power systems application. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	137
4	Nonintrusive load monitoring: A temporal multilabel classification approach	The article tackles the issues related to the identification of electrical appliances inside residential buildings. Each appliance can be identified from the aggregate power readings at the meter panel. The possibility of applying a temporal multilabel classification approach in the domain of nonintrusive load monitoring is explored (nonevent-based method). A novel set of metafeatures is proposed. The method is tested on sampling rates based on the capabilities of current smart meters. The proposed approach is validated over a dataset of energy readings at residences for a period of a year for 100 houses containing different sets of appliances (water heater, washing machines, etc.). This method is applicable for the demand side management of households in the current limitation of smart meters; from the inhabitants or from the grid operator's point of view. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	133
5	Utility function-based real-time control of a battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy system	This paper discusses a utility function-based control of a battery-ultracapacitor (UC) hybrid energy system. The example system employs the battery semiactive topology. In order to represent different performance and requirements of the battery and UC packs, the two packs are modeled as two independent but related agents using the NetLogo environment. Utility functions are designed to describe the respective preferences of battery and UC packs. Then, the control problem is converted to a multiobjective optimization problem solved by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The weights in the objective functions are chosen based on the location of the knee point in the Pareto set. Both the simulation and experimental results show the utility function-based control provides a comparable performance with the ideal average load demand (ALD)-based control, while the exact preknowledge of the future load demand is not required. The utility function-based control is fast enough to be directly implemented in real time. The discussion in this paper gives a starting point and initial results for dealing with more complex hybrid energy systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	56
6	Decision trees-aided active power reduction of a virtual power plant for power system over-frequency mitigation	The incorporation of distributed generation (DG) under the virtual power plant (VPP) paradigm allows the coherent central control, and the coordinated market integration of several and widely dispersed electric power sources. That way, VPPs can participate in frequency control by regulating in a coordinated manner their output power for the sake of system stability. This study analyzes a decision tree (DT)-based methodology that dispatches a requested reduction of active power within a VPP (among the sources it consists of), so as to support the mitigation of over-frequency. The presented control con-cept finds its application concerning grid support in case of over-frequency, and is also meant as a response to related reports and studies asking for the increased contribution of DG to overcome such phenomena. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	45
7	Spatial-temporal solar power forecasting for smart grids	The solar power penetration in distribution grids is growing fast during the last years, particularly at the low-voltage (LV) level, which introduces new challenges when operating distribution grids. Across the world, distribution system operators (DSO) are developing the smart grid concept, and one key tool for this new paradigm is solar power forecasting. This paper presents a new spatial-temporal forecasting method based on the vector autoregression framework, which combines observations of solar generation collected by smart meters and distribution transformer controllers. The scope is 6-h-ahead forecasts at the residential solar photovoltaic and medium-voltage (MV)/LV substation levels. This framework has been tested in the smart grid pilot of Évora, Portugal, and using data from 44 microgeneration units and 10 MV/LV substations. A benchmark comparison was made with the autoregressive forecasting model (AR - univariate model) leading to an improvement on average between 8% and 10%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	120
8	Fast prediction for sparse time series: Demand forecast of EV charging stations for cell phone applications	This paper proposes a new cellphone application algorithm which has been implemented for the prediction of energy consumption at electric vehicle (EV) charging stations at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). For this interactive user application, the total time for accessing the database, processing the data, and making the prediction needs to be within a few seconds. We first analyze three relatively fast machine learning-based time series prediction algorithms and find that the nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm (k NN with k = 1) shows better accuracy. Considering the sparseness of the time series of the charging records, we then discuss the new algorithm based on the new proposed time-weighted dot product (TWDP) dissimilarity measure to improve the accuracy and processing time. Two applications have been designed on top of the proposed prediction algorithm: one predicts the expected available energy at the outlet and the other one predicts the expected charging finishing time. The total time, including accessing the database, data processing, and prediction is approximately 1 s for both applications. The granularity of the prediction is 1 h and the horizon is 24 h; data have been collected from 20 EV charging outlets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	64
9	Implementation of Evolutionary Fuzzy PID Speed Controller for PM Synchronous Motor	We develop an evolutionary fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). We first consider a fuzzy PID control design problem based on the common control engineering knowledge that good transient performances can be obtained by increasing the P and I gains and decreasing the D gain when the transient error is big. Then we give an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to autotune the control parameters of the fuzzy PID controller. We implement the proposed EA-based fuzzy PID control controller in real time on a Texas Instruments TMS320F28335 floating-point DSP. We also give simulation and experimental results to show the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent digital control system under abrupt load torque variation using a prototype PMSM. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	86
10	Neural Speed Controller Trained Online by Means of Modified RPROP Algorithm	In this paper, the synthesis and the properties of the neural speed controller trained online are presented. The structure of the controller and the training algorithm are described. The resilient backpropagation (RPROP) algorithm was chosen for the training process of the artificial neural network (ANN). The algorithm was modified in order to improve controller operation. The specific properties of the controller, i.e., adaptation and auto-tuning, are illustrated by the results of both simulation and experimental research. An electric drive with permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) was chosen for experimental research, due to its impressive dynamics. The obtained results indicate that the presented controller may be implemented in industrial applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	55
11	A Modified Fuzzy Luenberger Observer for a Two-Mass Drive System	In this paper, issues related to the design of a fuzzy Luenberger observer for a drive system with a flexible joint is presented. The proposed estimator ensures shifting observer closed-loop poles in accordance with the present condition of the plant. The dynamic states are recognized on the basis of the error between the plant and estimator outputs (classical approach), as well as additional signal (difference between electromagnetic, and shaft torque and its derivative). Depending on these signals, the fuzzy systems determine the location of the observer poles. The proposed control structure is investigated through a number of experimental tests. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53
12	Identification of a Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell's Model Parameters by Means of an Evolution Strategy	This paper presents the parameter identification of an equivalent circuit-based proton-exchange membrane fuel cell model. This model is represented by two electrical circuits, of which one reproduces the fuel cell's output voltage characteristic and the other its thermal characteristic. The output voltage model includes activation, concentration, and ohmic losses, which describe the static properties, while the double-layer charging effect, which delays in fuel and oxygen supplies, and other effects provide the model's dynamic properties. In addition, a novel thermal model of the studied Ballard's 1.2-kW Nexa fuel cell is proposed. The latter includes the thermal effects of the stack's fan, which significantly improve the model's accuracy. The parameters of both, the electrical and the thermal, equivalent circuits were estimated on the basis of experimental data using an evolution strategy. The resulting parameters were validated by the measurement data obtained from the Nexa module. The comparison indicates a good agreement between the simulation and the experiment. In addition to simulations, the identified model is also suitable for usage in real-time fuel cell emulators. The emulator presented in this paper additionally proves the accuracy of the obtained model and the effectiveness of using an evolution strategy for identification of the fuel cell's parameters. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	58
13	A model-driven approach on object-oriented PLC programming for manufacturing systems with regard to usability	This paper presents the modular automation for reuse in manufacturing systems (modAT4rMS) approach to support the model-driven engineering (MDE) of object-oriented manufacturing automation software with regard to its usability and software modularity. With usability, we refer to the aspects' effectiveness, efficiency, and user acceptance as defined by ISO 9241-11. The modAT4rMS notations are based on selected features from the unified modeling language (UML) and the systems modeling language (SysML), and iteratively further developed by a series of empirical studies with industrial practitioners, as well as mechatronics trainees. With modAT4rMS, an MDE approach for programmable logic controller (PLC) programming was developed with the goal to facilitate modular object-oriented programming of PLC software by improving the representation of the relationships between the structure and behavior diagram types, and by reducing the level of abstraction in the structure model. modAT4rMS notations for PLC software structure and software behavior modeling are presented and illustrated with a modeling example using a modAT4rMS editor prototype. For the evaluation of the developed notations, the results from a study with 168 participants are presented, showing the benefits of this new approach in comparison with the classic procedural paradigm (IEC 61131-3) and the domain-specific UML profile (plcML) in regard to programming performance and usability aspects. Finally, the advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed, and an outlook for further development is given. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	28
14	Diffraction-compensating coded aperture for inspection in manufacturing	In this paper, we adopt the coded aperture technique to the alignment process for industrial machinery. As a special setting for assembly and inspection, such machinery uses an illumination of narrow wavelength range for imaging with less aberration. This leads to significant influence of light diffraction on the image restoration. Although the diffraction was treated as negligible in most previous studies of coded aperture since they were carried out for natural images, the aperture patterns of them do not achieve enough accuracy for the alignment. We optimize the aperture pattern by performing a simulation of light diffraction, and we experimentally show that it achieves better performance in the alignment. © 2014 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
15	Strategies and services for energy efficiency in real-time ethernet networks	The IEEE 802.3az amendment to the Ethernet standard, referred to as energy-efficient Ethernet (EEE), encompasses the new low power Idle operational mode that allows to strongly decrease the energy consumption of inactive links. The introduction of EEE in real-time industrial communications represents an interesting topic currently addressed by the scientific community, as well as by some standardization bodies. The outcomes of these activities are promising, since effective EEE strategies can be devised, and are able to cope with the very tight timing requirements of industrial communication. Unfortunately, the proposed analyses do not address implementation issues that, conversely, represent a crucial aspect in this scenario. Hence, in this paper, we specifically focus on practical issues concerned with the adoption of EEE strategies by real-time Ethernet (RTE) networks. At first, we address the use of commercially available network components and describe a measurement setup that can be adopted to achieve the adequate characterization of such components. Furthermore, we show that, in an RTE perspective, link activations/deactivations should be independently managed by suitably designed EEE strategies at the application level. Consequently, we defined a set of network services that have to be made available in the device drivers. Hence, we consider a generic RTE network and discuss methods for the practical implementation of those EEE strategies. A performance assessment carried out via theoretical models as well as numerical simulations shows that EEE strategies can be effectively implemented with considerable power savings at the expense of only minimal performance degradation. © 2015 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
16	Virtualization as a way to distribute PC-based functionalities	Virtualization theory is well known and successfully used in the computer domain. Personal computer (PC) workstations, as well as their virtual counterparts, are popular for general purposes. PC stations are also popular in networked control systems (NCSs). They are used as system components to deliver user interfaces and to run many important services of the data processing, communication, and database type. In this paper, the usage of virtual PC machines (VMs) is considered in the context of interoperability with NCS. This specific application area requests answers whether virtualization is applicable and secure, and what are the expectations from the temporal characteristics of running services. © 2014 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
17	Energy-efficient intrusion detection and mitigation for networked control systems security	This paper proposes an energy-efficient security-aware architecture for wireless control systems to be used in factory automation. We face deception attacks that corrupt commands and measurements in a smart way and with intermittent behavior to produce the highest damage without being discovered. The intrusion is hard to distinguish from normal disturbance. Furthermore, protection against attacks is energy-consuming and it would be desirable to activate protection only when needed. We propose packet-based selective encryption to reduce energy consumption, and to detect when an attack starts and ends. Since energy consumption depends also on packet transmission rate, especially during attacks, we also propose to adapt it according to instantaneous control performance. © 2015 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
18	Machine learning for predictive maintenance: A multiple classifier approach	"In this paper, a multiple classifier machine learning (ML) methodology for predictivemaintenance (PdM) is presented. PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating the so-called ""health factors,"" or quantitative indicators, of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management, and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance tradeoffs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime, and then employing this information in an operating cost-based maintenance decision system to minimize expected costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example and a benchmark semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem. © 2014 IEEE."	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	398
19	Implementation and evaluation of the reference broadcast infrastructure synchronization protocol	This paper describes reference broadcast infrastructure synchronization (RBIS), a clock synchronization protocol for IEEE 802.11 infrastructure wireless networks. The protocol is especially tailored for industrial and home automation networks, and inmany application contexts, it offers several advantages compared with other solutions targeted at similar purposes. RBIS has been conceived to rely on conventional Wi-Fi equipment and, in particular, on unmodified access points. It is based on the master/slave approach and follows the receiver/receiver paradigm. An implementation of RBIS-carried out completely in software and based on timestamps taken at the interrupt handler level-has been developed, which achieves a synchronization error below 3 μs. Then, a simple distributed hard real-time control application has been set up, which consists in two PCs running real-time application interface for Linux (RTAI) and connected through Wi-Fi. The actuation error, measured on the generation of synchronous pulses, is strictly below 13 μs. © 2015 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	36
20	Wireless sensor networks - Node localization for various industry problems	Fast and effective monitoring following airborne releases of toxic substances is critical to mitigate risks to threatened population areas. Electrically powered systems in industrial settings require monitoring of emitted electromagnetic fields to determine the status of the equipment and ensure their safe operation. In situations such as these, wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) at fixed predetermined locations provide monitoring to ensure safety. A challenging algorithmic problem is determining the locations to place these WSNs while meeting several criteria: 1) to provide complete coverage of the domain; 2) to create a topology with problem-dependent node densities; and 3) to minimize the number of WSNs. This paper presents a novel approach, advancing front mesh generation with constrained Delaunay triangulation and smoothing (AFECETS) that addresses these criteria. A unique aspect of AFECETS is the ability to determine WSN locations for areas of high interest (hospitals, schools, and high population density areas) that require higher density of nodes for monitoring environmental conditions, a feature that is difficult to find in other research work. The AFECETS algorithm was tested on several arbitrary shaped domains. AFECETS simulation results show that the algorithm provides significant reduction in the number of nodes, in some cases over 40%, compared with an advancing front mesh generation algorithm; maintains and improves optimal spacing between nodes; and produces simulation run times suitable for real-time applications. © 2015 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	51
21	Notes on feasibility and optimality conditions of small-scale multifunction robotic cell scheduling problems with pickup restrictions	Optimization of robotic workcells is a growing concern in automated manufacturing systems. This study develops a methodology to maximize the production rate of a multifunction robot (MFR) operating within a rotationally arranged robotic cell. An MFR is able to perform additional special operations while in transit between transferring parts from adjacent processing stages. Considering the free-pickup scenario, the cycle time formulas are initially developed for small-scale cells where an MFR interacts with either two or three machines. A methodology for finding the optimality regions of all possible permutations is presented. The results are then extended to the no-wait pickup scenario in which all parts must be processed from the input hopper to the output hopper, without any interruption either on or between machines. This analysis enables insightful evaluation of the productivity improvements of MFRs in real-life robotized workcells. ©2014 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
22	Priority-driven swapping-based scheduling of aperiodic real-time messages over EtherCAT networks	Real-time Ethernet (RTE) technologies are becoming increasingly popular, as they provide high bandwidth and are able to meet the requirements of industrial real-time communications. Among RTE protocols, the EtherCAT standard is suitable for motion control and closed-loop control applications, which require very short cycle times. As EtherCAT was specifically devised for periodic traffic, aperiodic real-time transmissions are far from being efficient, as they entail long cycle times. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a general framework for priority-driven swapping (PdS)-based scheduling of aperiodic real-time messages over EtherCAT networks, which uniformly covers both dynamic and static priority and allows for very short cycle times. This paper provides a description of the PdS framework, a schedulability analysis for both static priority and dynamic priority scheduling, and simulative assessments obtained through OMNeT++ simulations. © 2014 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20

25	Bridging service-oriented architecture and IEC 61499 for flexibility and interoperability	In recent years, requirements for interoperability, flexibility, and reconfigurability of complex automation industry applications have increased dramatically. The adoption of service-oriented architectures (SOAs) could be a feasible solution to meet these challenges. The IEC 61499 standard defines a set of management commands, which provides the capability of dynamic reconfiguration without affecting normal operation. In this paper, a formal model is proposed for the application of SOAs in the distributed automation domain in order to achieve flexible automation systems. Practical scenarios of applying SOA in industrial automation are discussed. In order to support the SOA IEC 61499 model, a service-based execution environment architecture is proposed. One main characteristic of flexibility-dynamic reconfiguration-is also demonstrated using a case study example. © 2015 IEEE.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	83
26	Compact low power wireless gas sensor node with thermo compensation for ubiquitous deployment	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently been applied for industrial monitoring, including combustible and flammable gases monitoring. In this work, we present a wireless gas sensor node in which a widely used Wheatstone sensing circuit based on two sensors is exchanged with a single sensor circuit, as well as the associate gas measurement procedure. The core of the measurement procedure is the four-stage heating profile, which enables low power consumption of sensing circuit and thermo compensation adjustment. A thermo compensation algorithm is capable of avoiding the effect of the environmental temperature on the measurements by keeping stable zero-offset within ±1 mV and ensuring low absolute error within 0.1% vol. The thorough design of the sensor node allows it to fit into the 5.5 cm3 packaging, which ensures its true ubiquitous deployment in outdoor and industrial environment. © 2015 IEEE.

27	On hierarchical power scheduling for the macrogrid and cooperative microgrids	Although considerable advances have been made in single microgrid (MG) systems, the problem of cooperation among MGs and the macrogrid has attracted considerable interest only recently. As in wireless communications systems, exploiting the temporal, spatial, and technological diversities in multiple cooperative MGs could bring about more efficient power generation and distribution. This paper investigates a hierarchical power scheduling approach to optimally manage power trading, storage, and distribution in a smart power grid with a macrogrid and cooperative MGs. We first formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and then decompose it into a two-tier formulation. The first-tier problem jointly considers user utility, transmission cost, and grid load variance, while the second-tier problem minimizes the power generation and transmission cost, and exploits distributed storage in the MGs. We develop an effective online algorithm to solve the first-tier problem and prove its asymptotic optimality, as well as a distributed optimal algorithm for solving the second-tier problem. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with trace-driven simulations and are shown to outperform several existing schemes with considerable gains. © 2015 IEEE.

28	A game theory-based energy management system using price elasticity for smart grids	Distributed devices in smart grid systems are decentralized and connected to the power grid through different types of equipment transmit, which will produce numerous energy losses when power flows from one bus to another. One of the most efficient approaches to reduce energy losses is to integrate distributed generations (DGs), mostly renewable energy sources. However, the uncertainty of DG may cause instability issues. Additionally, due to the similar consumption habits of customers, the peak load period of power consumption may cause congestion in the power grid and affect the energy delivery. Energy management with DG regulation is considered to be one of the most efficient solutions for solving these instability issues. In this paper, we consider a power system with both distributed generators and customers, and propose a distributed locational marginal pricing (DLMP)-based unified energy management system (uEMS) model, which, unlike previous works, considers both increasing profit benefits for DGs and increasing stability of the distributed power system (DPS). The model contains two parts: 1) a game theory-based loss reduction allocation (LRA); and 2) a load feedback control (LFC) with price elasticity. In the former component, we develop an iterative loss reduction method using DLMP to remunerate DGs for their participation in energy loss reduction. By using iterative LRA to calculate energy loss reduction, the model accurately rewards DG contribution and offers a fair competitive market. Furthermore, the overall profit of all DGs is maximized by utilizing game theory to calculate an optimal LRA scheme for calculating the distributed loss of every DG in each time slot. In the latter component of the model, we propose an LFC submodel with price elasticity, where a DLMP feedback signal is calculated by customer demand to regulate peak-load value. In uEMS, LFC first determines the DLMP signal of a customer bus by a time-shift load optimization (LO) algorithm based on the changes of customer demand, which is fed back to the DLMP of the customer bus at the next slot-time, allowing for peak-load regulation via price elasticity. Results based on the IEEE 37-bus feeder system show that the proposed uEMS model can increase DG benefits and improve system stability. © 2015 IEEE.

29	Fully distributed social welfare optimization with line flow constraint consideration	This paper proposes a fully distributed social welfare optimization solution that solves the economic dispatch and demand response problems in an integrated way. Compared with sequentially implementing these two operations one after another, the integrated solution can efficiently maximize the benefits of customers and minimize the generation cost of generators simultaneously. By adjusting both generations and dispatchable loads, line flow constraints and generation bounds can be satisfied easier. The proposed solution has two layers of operations for consensusbased information discovery and gradient-based generation or demand adjustment, respectively. It is fully distributed in the sense that there is no need for a specialized/central controller to coordinate the operations of the autonomous local controllers (agents). Compared with centralized solutions, the multiagent-systembased distributed solution is more reliable against single-point failures and can better accommodate customer participation. The proposed solution has been tested with a 5-bus system and the IEEE 30-bus system under light- and heavy-load conditions. Both static optimization and dynamic simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution. © 2015 IEEE.

30	Event-based distributed filtering with stochastic measurement fading	In this paper, we investigate the distributed filtering problem over wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with bandwidth and energy constraints. To utilize the limited resources efficiently, a novel event-based mechanism is proposed for the sensor node, such that only selected valuable data are broadcasted to its neighboring sensors via the wireless channel according to whether specific events happen. By resorting to graph theory and utilizing stochastic analysis methods, the filter parameters and the event triggering rules are designed, such that the filtering error converges at an exponential rate in the mean square sense. An adaptive algorithm for determining the triggering threshold is developed, which allows the intelligent sensors to tune the boundary of a local event domain in an online manner, so as to keep the average transmission rate level off a desired value. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2015 IEEE.

31	An incentivized auction-based group-selling approach for demand response management in V2G systems	Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system with efficient demand response management (DRM) is critical to solve the problem of supplying electricity by utilizing surplus electricity available at electric vehicles (EVs). An incentivized DRM approach is studied to reduce the system cost and maintain the system stability. EVs are motivated with dynamic pricing determined by the groupsellingbased auction. In the proposed approach, a number of aggregators sit on the first-level auction responsible to communicate with a group of EVs. EVs as bidders consider quality of energy (QoE) requirements, and report interests and decisions on the bidding process coordinated by the associated aggregator. Auction winners are determined based on the bidding prices and the amount of electricity sold by the EV bidders. We investigate the impact of the proposed mechanism on the system performance with maximum feedback power constraints of aggregators. The designed mechanism is proven to have essential economic properties. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism can reduce the system cost and offer EVs significant incentives to participate in the V2G DRM operation. © 2015 IEEE.

32	Fast distributed demand response with spatially and temporally coupled constraints in smart grid	As the next generation power grid, smart grid is characterized as an informationized system, and demand response is one of its important features to deal with the ever-increasing peak energy usage. However, the supply capacity and required demand make the demand response problem with both spatially and temporally coupled constraints, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been thoroughly investigated in a distributed manner. The complexity lies in how to guarantee privacy and convergence of distributed algorithms. Aiming at this challenge, in this paper, we first propose a distributed algorithm, which is based on dual decomposition and does not require each user to reveal his/her private information. Then, the convergence analysis is conducted to provide guidance on how to choose the proper step size; through which, we notice that the convergence speed of the subgradient projection method is not fast enough and it is highly dependent on the choice of the step size. Therefore, to increase the convergence rate of the distributed algorithm, we further propose a fast approach based on binary search. Finally, the distributed algorithms are illustrated by numerical simulations and the extensive comparison results validate the better performance of the fast approach. © 2015 IEEE.

33	COPE: Improving energy efficiency with coded preambles in low-power sensor networks	Energy efficiency is one of the most important factors that affect the applicability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in many practical scenarios. Many low-power media access control (MAC) protocols have been proposed in the past decade to improve the energy efficiency of sensor nodes. In these lowpower MAC protocols, preambles are widely used to wake up the receivers asynchronizely. However, the data delivery potential of these preambles has not been exploited. In this paper, we propose a coded preamble (COPE), which exploits the data delivery potential of preambles by encoding the preambles by network coding. COPE has two salient features. First, a passive receiver set selection scheme enables nodes to decide whether to receive the overheard preamble packets, without introducing extra communication overhead. Second, COPE supports multiple routing primitives, such as unicast and broadcast, making it be a versatile 2.5 layer between the low-power link layer (layer 2) and the network layer (layer 3). We analyze COPE by a novel analytical model. Results show that COPE is able to improve the energy efficiency of both unicast and broadcast significantly. We also implement COPE in TinyOS/TelosB platform and evaluate its energy efficiency. Results show that COPE significantly reduces the radio-ON-time in practical network settings. © 2015 IEEE.

34	Optimal household appliances scheduling under day-ahead pricing and load-shaping demand response strategies	In this paper, a detailed home energy management system structure is developed to determine the optimal dayahead appliance scheduling of a smart household under hourly pricing and peak power-limiting (hard and soft power limitation)-based demand response strategies. All types of controllable assets have been explicitly modeled, including thermostatically controllable (air conditioners and water heaters) and nonthermostatically controllable (washing machines and dishwashers) appliances, together with electric vehicles (EVs). Furthermore, an energy storage system (ESS) and distributed generation at the end-user premises are taken into account. Bidirectional energy flow is also considered through advanced options for EV and ESS operation. Finally, a realistic test-case is presented with a sufficiently reduced time granularity being thoroughly discussed to investigate the effectiveness of the model. Stringent simulation results are provided using data gathered from real appliances and real measurements. © 2015 IEEE.

35	Energy-efficient dynamic packet downloading for medical IoT platforms	This paper proposes a polynomial-time algorithm for energy-efficient dynamic packet downloading from medical cloud storage to medical Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The medical cloud can distribute its own medical data to medical IoT devices via access points. Therefore, network disconnection can happen between the medical cloud and medical IoT devices when power/energy management in each access point is not efficient. This situation is especially harmful in in-hospital network architectures, because the architecture usually has strict requirements in terms of reliability. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic energy-efficient algorithm, which computes the amount of power allocation in each access point based on the buffer backlog size and channel states under the consideration of buffer stability. With the proposed adaptive algorithm, each access point calibrates its own parameters for more adaptive power/energy management. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of network lifetime, and it is observed that the proposed algorithm achieves the desired performance. © 2015 IEEE.

36	Strategic offering for a price-maker wind power producer in oligopoly markets considering demand response exchange	This paper proposes an offering strategy for a wind power producer (WPP) that participates in both day-ahead (DA) and balancing oligopoly markets as a price maker. Penetration of demand response (DR) resources into smart grids is modeled by intraday demand response exchange (IDRX) architecture. A bilevel optimization framework is proposed based on multiagent system and incomplete information game theory. Modeling the WPPs in high penetration of wind power as price makers can reflect the capability of this market player to directly affect the market prices. Simulation results indicate that the price-taker model of WPP is not accurate forWPPs that have significant market shares. By comparing the results obtained from modeling the WPPs as price makers with the ones as price takers, it can be concluded that WPPs have the market power not only to increase the prices of both DA and balancing markets, but also to reduce the amount of DR through IDRX market mechanism. © 2015 IEEE.

37	A cooperative demand response scheme using punishment mechanism and application to industrial refrigerated warehouses	This paper proposes a cooperative demand response (CDR) scheme for load management in smart grid. The CDR scheme is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that generates a Pareto-optimal response strategy profile for consumers. Comparing with the noncooperative response strategy (i.e., Nash equilibrium) obtained from the one-shot demand management game, the Pareto-optimal response strategy reduces the electricity costs to the consumers. We further develop an incentivecompatible trigger-and-punishment mechanism to avoid the noncooperative behaviors of the selfish consumers. Furthermore, the CDR scheme is applied to achieve load management of industrial refrigerated warehouses. To implement the CDR scheme in largescale systems, we group the refrigerated warehouses into clusters and utilize the CDR scheme within each cluster. Numerical results demonstrate that the CDR scheme can reduce the electricity costs, drop the electricity prices, and curtail the total energy consumption in comparison with the noncooperative demand response scheme. © 2015 IEEE.

38	Oppcode: Correlated opportunistic coding for energy-efficient flooding in wireless sensor networks	Existing work on flooding in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) mainly focuses on single-packet problem, while the work on sequential multipacket problem is surprisingly little. This paper proposes OppCode, a new opportunistic networkcoding-based flooding architecture for multipacket dissemination in WSNs, where both unreliable and correlated links commonly exist. Instead of flooding a single packet each time, each node encodes multiple native packets chosen from a specific fixedsize page to an encoded packet and then rebroadcasts it further. The key idea consists of two parts. One is opportunistically coding decision, in which each node grasps every possible coding opportunity greedily to maximize its aggregate coding gain of all neighbors based on the probabilistic estimation of packets each neighbor already has. The other is paged collective acknowledgements (ACKs), in which one rebroadcast acts as not only an implicit ACK of successful disseminations of all packets in the entire page for the sender, but also probabilistic ACK to update page-scale per-packet coverage estimations for its neighbors in a batch. Experiments based on extensive simulations and 21-node testbed show that OppCode significantly increases performance of multipacket flooding in terms of reliability, transmission overhead, delay, and load balance. © 2015 IEEE.

39	Optimal pricing and energy scheduling for hybrid energy trading market in future smart grid	Future smart grid (SG) has been considered a complex and advanced power system, where energy consumers are connected not only to the traditional energy retailers (e.g., the utility companies), but also to some local energy networks for bidirectional energy trading opportunities. This paper aims to investigate a hybrid energy trading market that is comprised of an external utility company and a local trading market managed by a local trading center (LTC). The existence of local energy market provides new opportunities for the energy consumers and the distributed energy sellers to perform the local energy trading in a cooperative manner such that they all can benefit. This paper first quantifies the respective benefits of the energy consumers and the sellers from the local trading and then investigates how they can optimize their benefits by controlling their energy scheduling in response to the LTC's pricing. Two different types of the LTC are considered: 1) the nonprofit-oriented LTC, which solely aims at benefiting the energy consumers and the sellers; and 2) the profit-oriented LTC, which aims at maximizing its own profit while guaranteeing the required benefit for each consumer and seller. For each type of the LTC, the optimal trading problem is formulated and the associated algorithm is further proposed to efficiently find the LTC's optimal price, as well as the optimal energy scheduling for each consumer and seller. Numerical results are provided to validate the benefits of the hybrid energy trading market and the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.

40	Novel active time-based demand response for industrial consumers in smart grid	Time-based demand response (DR) enables industrial consumers to transfer their power consumption by following daily price curve. However, general time-based DR is basically a passive tariff. Utilities usually create general pricing tariff to the whole industrial consumers at the same voltage connection level. Under this situation, consumption transformation of all possible industries occurs together. It may reduce the effect of load characteristics improvement. This paper introduces a new pricing framework named active time-based (ATB) DR to overcome this weak point. Under this tariff, consumers are classified in details. Utilities select target consumers, communicate with them actively, and provide a specified price curve for the industries covered by target consumer group. With a practical survey, this paper implements ATB with the best behavioral scheme (BBS) model and industrial consumer attitude model. This paper includes a numerical case study on cement manufacturing for further analysis. Data acquisition, BBS simulation, consumer attitude estimation, and an investigation on electricity pricing are covered by this case study. © 2015 IEEE.

41	Risk-Based Power System Security Analysis Considering Cascading Outages	Successful development of smart grid demands strengthened system security and reliability, which requires effective security analysis in conducting system operation and expansion planning. Classical N - 1 criterion has been widely used to examine every creditable contingency through detailed computations in the past. The adequacy of such approach becomes doubtful in many recent blackouts where cascading outages are usually involved. This may be attributed to the increased complexities and nonlinearities involved in operating conditions and network structures in context of smart grid development. To address security threats, particularly from cascading outages, a new and efficient security analysis approach is proposed, which comprises cascading failure simulation module (CFSM) for postcontingency analysis and risk evaluation module (REM) based on a decorrelated neural network ensembles (DNNE) algorithm. This approach overcomes the drawbacks of high computational cost in classical N-k-induced cascading contingency analysis. Case studies on two different IEEE test systems and a practical transmission system - Polish 2383-bus system have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for risk evaluation of cascading contingency. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	61
42	Node Localization in Robotic Sensor Networks for Pipeline Inspection	Robotic sensor networks provide an effective approach for underground pipeline inspection. Such networks are comprised of sensor nodes (SNs) and relay nodes (RNs) carried by robots for information sensing and communication, and are able to perform accurate and realtime inspection, especially in adverse environments. SN localization is critical in such networks because localization results can be used not only for locating and pinpointing leaks, but also for maneuvering mobile SNs in a pipeline of complex configuration. However, both the underground operational environment and the limited resources of the SNs pose significant challenges for SN localization. This paper presents algorithms for SN localization in robotic sensor networks for underground pipeline inspection. Specifically, self-localization of underground in-pipe SNs were investigated by taking into account SN movement dynamics, and using the measurements of the SN's velocity and the received signal strength (RSS) of the radio signal from aboveground RNs. Depending on the availability of the RSS at the SN, different localization algorithms based on the Kalman filter are proposed for different scenarios. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. The framework also provides insight into the design of robotic sensor networks for the inspection and maintenance of other types of pipeline systems, such as oil and gas pipelines. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	71
43	Optimal Battery Sizing in Microgrids Using Probabilistic Unit Commitment	The Stochastic nature of wind power can cause insufficiency of supply in electrical systems. Applying an energy storage system can alleviate the impact of wind power forecast error on power systems performance and increase system tolerance against deficiency of supply. This paper attempts to investigate a new unit commitment (UC) problem based on the cost-benefit analysis and here-and-now (HN) approach for optimal sizing of battery banks (BBs) imicrogrids (MGs) with wind power systems. To solve this problem, particle swarm optimization is used to minimize the total cost and maximize the total benefit. In this paper, 12 scenarios have been considered in the presence of BBs and without them in 2 operating modes: 1) stand-alone mode and 2) grid-connected mode. Using the HN approach, the uncertainty of wind power is applied as a constraint in these operating modes. The mathematical formulations related to the HN approach in MGs and its combination in a UC problem are presented in detail for optimal sizing of BBs. Simulation results show that the best sizes of BBs and the scheduling of distributed generations would be entirely different when the accessibility of wind power is taken into consideration by applying HN approach to the proposed probabilistic UC problem. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	103
44	Lifetime and Energy Hole Evolution Analysis in Data-Gathering Wireless Sensor Networks	Network lifetime is a crucial performance metric to evaluate data-gathering wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where battery-powered sensor nodes periodically sense the environment and forward collected samples to a sink node. In this paper, we propose an analytic model to estimate the entire network lifetime from network initialization until it is completely disabled, and determine the boundary of energy hole in a data-gathering WSN. Specifically, we theoretically estimate the traffic load, energy consumption, and lifetime of sensor nodes during the entire network lifetime. Furthermore, we investigate the temporal and spatial evolution of energy hole and apply our analytical results to WSN routing in order to balance the energy consumption and improve the network lifetime. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed analytic model in estimating the network lifetime and energy hole evolution process. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	176

47	Multiport UHF RFID-Tag Antenna for Enhanced Energy Harvesting of Self-Powered Wireless Sensors	This paper presents the design and experimental evaluation of a long-range solar powered sensorenhanced radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. The tag antenna is a multiport microstrip patch with an overlay of thin-film solar cells for energy harvesting. A second port is allocated on the patch antenna for supplementary energy harvesting from the RF signal transmitted by the reader. An I2C-RFID chip along with a microcontroller unit (MCU) and temperature and humidity sensor are incorporated into the tag design to implement a low-cost wireless sensor using a commercial RFID reader. The measurements of the fabricated RFID-tag sensor demonstrate that a maximum sensing/reading range of 27 m is achieved when all the circuits are powered using solar cells, while it is 7.48m with only the secondary option of energy harvesting. The proposed sensor with dual energy harvesting achieves both a longer range and a lifetime compared with similar battery-powered sensor-enhanced RFID tags. The RFID sensor is also evaluated in a climate chamber and the sensor data (temperature/humidity) were remotely recorded with an excellent accuracy using a commercial ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID reader. In addition, the sensor can be programmed for the temperature/humidity surveillance of sensitive items, such as those found in various supply chain and transportation applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	50
48	Intercept Behavior Analysis of Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks in the Presence of Eavesdropping Attack	This paper studies the intercept behavior of an industrial wireless sensor network (WSN) consisting of a sink node and multiple sensors in the presence of an eavesdropping attacker, where the sensors transmit their sensed information to the sink node through wireless links. Due to the broadcast nature of radio wave propagation, the wireless transmission from the sensors to the sink can be readily overheard by the eavesdropper for interception purposes. In an information-theoretic sense, the secrecy capacity of the wireless transmission is the difference between the channel capacity of the main link (from sensor to sink) and that of the wiretap link (from sensor to eavesdropper). If the secrecy capacity becomes nonpositive due to the wireless fading effect, the sensor's data transmission could be successfully intercepted by the eavesdropper and an intercept event occurs in this case. However, in industrial environments, the presence of machinery obstacles, metallic frictions, and engine vibrations makes the wireless fading fluctuate drastically, resulting in the degradation of the secrecy capacity. As a consequence, an optimal sensor scheduling scheme is proposed in this paper to protect the legitimate wireless transmission against the eavesdropping attack, where a sensor with the highest secrecy capacity is scheduled to transmit its sensed information to the sink. Closed-form expressions of the probability of occurrence of an intercept event (called intercept probability) are derived for the conventional round-robin scheduling and the proposed optimal scheduling schemes. Also, an asymptotic intercept probability analysis is conducted to provide an insight into the impact of the sensor scheduling on the wireless security. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed sensor scheduling scheme outperforms the conventional round-robin scheduling in terms of the intercept probability. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	88

50	Feature Extraction and Power Quality Disturbances Classification Using Smart Meters Signals	This paper presents a methodology aimed at extracting features to obtain information that will highlight disturbances related to the field of power quality. Due to the concept of smart grids, it is clear that the classification of the disturbances should be undertaken using smart meters, so that a large amount of data corresponding to the voltage and current waveforms are not exchanged using the communication channels, i.e., between smart meter and Utility's database server. Thus, it is necessary to ensure a balance between computational effort (arising from the implementation of algorithms on hardware) and the satisfactory performance of the algorithm for the classification of disturbances. Based on the assumption that the classification task is onerous, this paper proposes a step of feature extraction that may be calculated and analyzed offline using synthetic waveforms/signals, which are subsequently validated using field measurements. It should be noted that this offline analysis is required to determine the most relevant features for the process of classifying each disturbance. However, in order to establish the effectiveness of the feature extraction step, the response of decision trees of the C4.5 type and of artificial neural networks of the multilayer perceptron type were verified during the phase of disturbance classification. In short, good results were obtained that corroborate the hypothesis that the feature extraction step is necessary to classify disturbances effectively and with low computational effort. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	151
51	Distributed Approach for SmartGrids Reconfiguration Based on the OSPF Routing Protocol	Smart grids (SG) are essential for efficient management and monitoring of electric power networks. One of the most important tasks in SG focuses on fault detection and automatic network reconfiguration. This process allows minimizing power losses and load balancing in distribution networks. In this paper, an adaptation of the open shortest path first (OSPF) routing protocol to accomplish the network reconfiguration task is proposed. The algorithm is intended to run in secondary substation nodes over an agent-based distributed architecture. The proposed algorithm has been tested on the IEEE 123 modified node test feeder and on an actual grid deployed by an electrical distribution company. Moreover, a performance comparison with a typical centralized reconfiguration algorithm is carried out. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	29
52	End-to-End Reliability-Aware Scheduling for Wireless Sensor Networks	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are gaining popularity as a flexible and economical alternative to field-bus installations for monitoring and control applications. For mission-critical applications, communication networks must provide end-to-end reliability guarantees, posing substantial challenges for WSN. Reliability can be improved by redundancy, and is often addressed on the MAC layer by resubmission of lost packets, usually applying slotted scheduling. Recently, researchers have proposed a strategy to optimally improve the reliability of a given schedule by repeating the most rewarding slots in a schedule incrementally until a deadline. This Incrementer can be used with most scheduling algorithms but has scalability issues which narrows its usability to offline calculations of schedules, for networks that are rather static. In this paper, we introduce SchedEx, a generic heuristic scheduling algorithm extension, which guarantees a user-defined end-to-end reliability. SchedEx produces competitive schedules to the existing approach, and it does that consistently more than an order of magnitude faster. The harsher the end-to-end reliability demand of the network, the better the SchedEx performs compared to the Incrementer. We further show that SchedEx has a more evenly distributed improvement impact on the scheduling algorithms, whereas the Incrementer favors schedules created by certain scheduling algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	86
53	Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction for Big Data Time Series Regression	In many applications, and especially those where batch processes are involved, a target scalar output of interest is often dependent on one or more time series of data. With the exponential growth in data logging in modern industries, such time series are increasingly available for statistical modeling in soft sensing applications. In order to exploit time-series data for predictive modeling, it is necessary to summarize the information they contain as a set of features to use as model regressors. Typically this is done in an unsupervised fashion using simple techniques such as computing statistical moments, principal components or wavelet decompositions, often leading to significant information loss, and hence suboptimal predictive models. In this paper, a functional learning paradigm is exploited in a supervised fashion to derive continuous smooth estimates of time-series data (yielding aggregated local information), while simultaneously estimating a continuous shape function yielding optimal predictions. The proposed supervised aggregative feature extraction (SAFE) methodology can be extended to support nonlinear predictive models by embedding the functional learning framework in a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) setting. SAFE has a number of attractive features including closed-form solution and the ability to explicitly incorporate first- and second-order derivative information. Using simulation studies and a practical semiconductor manufacturing case study, we highlight the strengths of the new methodology with respect to standard unsupervised feature extraction approaches. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	50
54	Dynamic Pricing and Risk Analytics under Competition and Stochastic Reference Price Effects	This paper investigates the pricing strategy of firms in the context of uncertain demand. In particular, there are two factors that affect demand dynamics, the influence of reference prices and the price of the competition. In the monopoly case, pricing policy is affected by reference-price effects and in the duopoly case, both competitive pricing and reference-price effects are present. In each case, the optimal price paths are derived and simulated. The implications of uncertainty are analyzed by comparing the deterministic policy with the stochastic policy. The random variations in price paths are investigated to provide a risk analysis for firms that work in such market conditions. With the advent of the big data era, information about consumers and competitors gives firms a greater control over uncertainty than ever before. Simulations will demonstrate that firms can lower the volatility of their price path if they gather and process this information. Furthermore, the feedback forms of the optimal price path are derived in both the absence and the presence of both competition and reference-price effects. In general, the impact that demand uncertainty has over the firm's pricing strategy is determined by a combination of the firm's discount rate, demand uncertainty, and demand-side/cost-side dynamics. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25
55	A Big Data Clustering Algorithm for Mitigating the Risk of Customer Churn	As market competition intensifies, customer churn management is increasingly becoming an important means of competitive advantage for companies. However, when dealing with big data in the industry, existing churn prediction models cannot work very well. In addition, decision makers are always faced with imprecise operations management. In response to these difficulties, a new clustering algorithm called semantic-driven subtractive clustering method (SDSCM) is proposed. Experimental results indicate that SDSCM has stronger clustering semantic strength than subtractive clustering method (SCM) and fuzzy c-means (FCM). Then, a parallel SDSCM algorithm is implemented through a Hadoop MapReduce framework. In the case study, the proposed parallel SDSCM algorithm enjoys a fast running speed when compared with the other methods. Furthermore, we provide some marketing strategies in accordance with the clustering results and a simplified marketing activity is simulated to ensure profit maximization. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	98
56	A Real-Time Big Data Gathering Algorithm Based on Indoor Wireless Sensor Networks for Risk Analysis of Industrial Operations	The era of big data has begun and an enormous amount of real-time data is used for the risk analysis of various industrial applications. However, a technical challenge exists in gathering real-time big data in a complex indoor industrial environment. Indoor wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technology can overcome this limitation by collecting the big data generated from source nodes and transmitting them to the data center in real time. In this study, typical residence, office, and manufacturing environments were chosen. The signal transmission characteristics of an indoor WSN were obtained by analyzing the test data. According to these characteristics, a real-time big data gathering (RTBDG) algorithm based on an indoor WSN is proposed for the risk analysis of industrial operations. In this algorithm, sensor nodes can screen the data collected from the environment and equipment according to the requirements of risk analysis. Clustering data transmission structure is then established on the basis of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and residual energy information. Experimental results show that RTBDG not only uses the limited energy of network nodes efficiently, but also balances the energy consumption of all nodes. In the near future, the algorithm will be widely applied to risk analysis in different industrial operations. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	67

58	Data-Driven System Reliability and Failure Behavior Modeling Using FMECA	System reliability modeling needs a large amount of data to estimate the parameters. In addition, reliability estimation is associated with uncertainty. This paper aims to propose a new method to evaluate the failure behavior and reliability of a large system using failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA). Therefore, qualitative data based on the judgment of experts are used when data are not sufficient. The subjective data of failure modes and causes have been aggregated through the system to develop an overall failure index (OFI). This index not only represents the system reliability behavior, but also prioritizes corrective actions based on improvements in system failure. In addition, two optimization models are presented to select optimal actions subject to budget constraint. The associated costs of each corrective action are considered in risk evaluation. Finally, a case study of a manufacturing line is introduced to verify the applicability of the proposed method in industrial environments. The proposed method is compared with conventional FMECA approach. It is shown that the proposed method has a better performance in risk assessment. A sensitivity analysis is provided on the budget amount and the results are discussed. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	33
59	European Option Pricing with a Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm for Big Data Analysis	Several empirical studies show that, under multiple risks, markets exhibit many new properties, such as volatility smile and cluster fueled by the explosion of transaction data. This paper attempts to capture these newly developed features using the valuation of European options as a vehicle. Statistical analysis performed on the data collected from the currency option market clearly shows the coexistence of mean reversion, jumps, volatility smile, and leptokurtosis and fat tail. We characterize the dynamics of the underlying asset in this kind of environment by establishing a coupled stochastic differential equation model with triple characteristics of mean reversion, nonaffine stochastic volatility, and mixed-exponential jumps. Moreover, we propose a characteristic function method to derive the closed-form pricing formula. We also present a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm-based numerical solution method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate both the modeling methodology and the numerical algorithm. Results demonstrate that the model behaves well in capturing the properties observed in the market, and the FFT numerical algorithm is both accurate and efficient in addressing large amount of data. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19

However, compared with conventional injection molding, microinjection molding requires an adapted processing due to larger surface-area-to-volume ratios, as well as higher shear and cooling rates. Since the functionality of the final parts depends on their defect-free fabrication, a fast, robust, and reliable quality inspection of the final part is mandatory. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of computational shear interferometry (CoSI) for the quality inspection of microinjection molding parts. An analytic model based on the Jones matrix is developed to predict what information of the light field generated behind the inspected part is measured using CoSI technique. A microinjection molding part having spiral shape is inspected indicating areas with manufacturing defects, such as air bubbles, scratches, and internal stresses. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
64	Colorful 3-D Imaging Using an Infrared Dammann Grating	3-D profilometry is one of the most important branches of measurement science and technology. In this paper, a new colorful 3-D imaging method using near-infrared (NIR) laser (850 nm) dot array generated by a Dammann grating is proposed. Two NIR cameras mounted with narrowband passed filters are adopted to capture laser patterns on objects. A color camera mounted with an infrared cutoff filter is adopted to capture color information. A simplified multiviews' matching method for dot array, which is the key of this 3-D imaging system, is proposed. A new geometric constraint named ray constraint is applied to multiview matching with the help of precalibration of laser dot array. Point clouds with color information are obtained according to triangulation. We used the experimental apparatus to scan a colorful plane with colorful attachments on it, and its colorful point clouds (about 56 000 sample points) were obtained. Experiments demonstrate that this apparatus achieves a depth accuracy of 0.21 mm at the measuring distance of 300 mm. This new colorful 3-D imaging has advantages of low cost, low power consumption, flexible structure, and portability, which should be highly interesting for practical applications. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
65	Review of Holographic Printers for Computer-Generated Holograms	Two different types of holographic printers have been developed that can output holograms on photosensitive materials from digital data calculated as computer-generated holograms to display three-dimensional (3-D) images. The first one is the holographic fringe printer that can write a thin transmission hologram. The other one is the volume hologram printer to write a thick reflection hologram. These printers can output holograms that can provide all physiological depth cues the same as real objects. Therefore, reconstructed images are very natural and do not provide the accommodation-convergence conflict like other 3-D display systems, such as stereoscopic displays. This paper introduces basics of printers, improvements, and reconstructed images. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26

Autocorrelation is used to quantify the quality of all the reconstructed images from the holograms.

67	Color Holographic Wavefront Printing Technique for Realistic Representation	This paper presents design and implementation of a color wavefront holographic printer. The printer output is a white light viewable volume hologram composed as a two-dimensional (2-D) array of elemental holograms. The three-dimensional (3-D) input data for the printer are encoded as computer generated holograms (CGHs) displayed in succession on an amplitude type spatial light modulator. The printer optical head extracts and demagnifies the beam with the 3-D object information from the beam diffracted by the modulator to produce a small size elemental hologram. This allows for mosaic delivery of exposures at primary colors with each elemental hologram acting as a single color channel. Computer generation of digital contents is accelerated by design of a phase-added stereogram approach based on partitioning of each CGH. Bright 3-D reconstruction with a motion parallax at saturated colors from holograms of test objects is presented. The holograms are printed on a silver-halide emulsion. The achieved high quality proves feasibility of recording analog color volume holograms from digital contents by mosaic delivery of the primary colors. Two quality enhancement approaches are proposed and tested. © 2014 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10

69	Design and Real-Time Controller Implementation for a Battery-Ultracapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System	In this study, two real-time energy management strategies have been investigated for optimal current split between batteries and ultracapacitors (UCs) in electric vehicle applications. In the first strategy, an optimization problem is formulated and solved using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to obtain the real-time operation points of current split for the hybrid energy storage system (HESS). In the second strategy, a neural network-based strategy is implemented as an intelligent controller for the proposed system. To evaluate the performance of these two real-time strategies, a performance metric based on the battery state-of-health (SoH) is developed to reveal the relative impact of instantaneous battery currents on the battery degradation. A 38 V-385 Wh battery and a 32 V-4.12 Wh UC HESS hardware prototype has been developed and a real-time experimental platform has been built for energy management controller validation, using xPC Target and National Instrument data acquisition system. Both the simulation and real-time experiment results have successfully validated the real-time implementation feasibility and effectiveness of the two real-time controller designs. It is shown that under a high speed, high acceleration, aggressive drive cycle US06, the two real-time energy management strategies can greatly reduce the battery peak current and consequently decreases the battery SoH reduction by 31% and 38% in comparison to a battery-only energy storage system. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	108
70	Distributed Real-Time Pricing Control for Large-Scale Unidirectional V2G with Multiple Energy Suppliers	With the increasing trend in adoption of plug-in hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles, they will play a prominent role in the future electric energy market by acting as responsive loads to increase the grid stability and facilitate the integration of renewables. However, due to the large number of controllable devices in the future grid, central vehicle to grid (V2G) management would be challenging and vulnerable to single points of failure. This paper introduces a novel distributed approach for optimal management of unidirectional V2G considering multiple energy suppliers. Each charging station as well as each energy supplier is equipped with a local price regulator to control the price paid to the energy suppliers and the price paid by the vehicles through coordination with their neighbors. In response to the updated prices, the vehicles adjust their charging rates and energy suppliers adjust their production to maximize their benefit. The main advantages of the proposed approach are that it manages unidirectional V2G in a fully distributed way considering multiple energy suppliers and vehicles, and it converges to the global optimum despite the greedy behavior of the individuals. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	39
71	Sensing and Decision Making in Cyber-Physical Systems: The Case of Structural Event Monitoring	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being suggested at an increasing rate for structural health monitoring (SHM). The objective is to monitor complex events (e.g., damage) in structures (e.g., an industrial machine and a high-rise building) that are usually carried out with wired-based SHM systems. However, monitoring events with a WSN deployed over large structures is challenging due to WSN constraints (high-resolution data transmission and energy) and the quality of monitoring. In this paper, we attempt to design a cyber-physical system (CPS) of structural event monitoring with WSNs and propose a novel model-based in-network decision making in the CPS named MODEM. We think of the idea of generic event detection (like target/object) schemes, and enable each sensor to sense and make a simplified local decision (0/1) on the complex events. We then think of the formation of engineering structures and find that a large physical structure consists of a number of substructures. We enable deployed sensors to be organized into groups in such a way that a groupwise final decision (e.g., 0/1) can be provided for each substructure independently so that the existence of an event (if there is any) in a specific substructure can be identified by WSNs. MODEM is fully distributed in nature, promises to have the monitoring quality similar to the original wired-based schemes, and consumes much less energy for transmissions and computations than existing schemes do. The effectiveness of MODEM is shown via both simulations and real experiments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	69
72	A Load-Aware Pluggable Cloud Framework for Real-Time Video Processing	A large number of video applications require real-time response. The high-speed video processing then requires a distributed and parallelized framework utilizing all possible computing resources, i.e., both Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) at their best. The CPU-GPU collaboration may cause resource imbalance where GPU-based jobs consume less computing resources while occupying more memory compared with CPU-based jobs. In this paper, we propose a load-aware pluggable cloud framework for real-time video processing where CPU-GPU switching based on workload status can be performed at runtime. Furthermore, we design aspect-oriented monitors to collect framework metrics and propose a distance coverage algorithm to detect performance degradation in order to make sure that the framework runs optimally to achieve good performance when a load-aware task switching is made. We have comprehensively evaluated the framework and the evaluation results show that the proposed framework has good performance, reusability, pluggability, and scalability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
73	Low-Power Fall Detector Using Triaxial Accelerometry and Barometric Pressure Sensing	Falls are the number one cause of injuries in the elderly. A wearable fall detector can automatically detect the occurrence of a fall and alert a caregiver or a medical rescue group for immediate assistance, mitigating fall-related injuries. However, most studies on fall detection to date have focused on the accuracy of detection while neglecting power efficiency and battery life, and hence the developed fall detectors usually cannot operate for a long period (a year or more) without recharging or replacing their batteries. This paper presents a low-power fall detector that utilizes triaxial accelerometry and barometric pressure sensing. This fall detector reduces its power consumption through both hardware- and firmware-based approaches. This study also incorporates several human trials to develop and evaluate the device, including simulated falls and activities of daily living. A benchtop power measurement test is also conducted to estimate the battery life with data from a one-week free-living trial. These experiments show that the fall detector achieves high sensitivity (97.5% and 93.0%) and specificity (93.2% and 87.3%) on training and testing datasets, while providing an estimated battery life of 664.9 days. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	47
74	Temporal-Correlation-Aware Dynamic Self-Management of Wireless Sensor Networks	In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensor observations are spatiotemporally correlated, and that correlation signifies redundancy among the observations. Spatial correlation is primarily employed to estimate the minimum number of event-monitoring nodes. However, an event-monitoring node can intelligently exploit the temporal correlation between its observations to adapt with its dynamic surroundings. This self-adaptation helps resource-constrained nodes to enhance their performance by saving battery power and maintaining the quality of transmitted data. In WSNs, the sensor nodes switch between the active and sleep states to conserve energy. Using temporal correlation, a node can dynamically estimate the appropriate sleep duration, which is an important parameter for a node to adapt with its dynamic surroundings in an energy-efficient manner. In this paper, dynamic Bayesian network and entropy are used to estimate utility of observations. Moreover, a node estimates temporal correlation between its consecutive observations by mutual information. Further, the sensor nodes calculate appropriate sleep duration and control their communications at a particular time instant on the basis of estimated temporal correlation. A reinforcement-learning-based approach is used, in a distributed manner, to calculate the optimum sleep duration. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed approach performs more efficiently in terms of energy conservation, energy utilization, and data accuracy than the benchmark schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
75	Toward Belief Function-Based Cooperative Sensing for Interference Resistant Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks	In harsh and heterogeneous wireless environments, the communication reliability and latency of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) seriously suffer from both intra- and interinterference. This paper presents an interference resistant approach for IWSNs by utilizing cognitive radio techniques. To improve the interference detection performance while uploading data as little as possible, we present a new computationally efficient and effective belief function (BF) theory-based reliability-probability decision fusion rule for cooperative sensing. A factor called reliability degree is introduced to characterize the imprecision of sensor observations, and the basic belief assignments are constructed by combining this reliability degree and local detection performance. Unlike the inefficient existing BF-based fusion schemes, the proposed rule has an explicit form and it is equivalent to the well-known Chair-Vashney (CV) rule in high signal-to-noise ratio conditions. We applied the proposed rule in interference resistant IWSNs to detect and avoid interference. Both numerical results and tests results demonstrate that the proposed rule has significant improvement in detection performance, diversity gains, and throughput compared with existing BF fusion schemes and CV rule. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23
76	Smart Insole: A Wearable Sensor Device for Unobtrusive Gait Monitoring in Daily Life	Gait analysis is an important medical diagnostic process and has many applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, therapy, and exercise training. However, typical gait analysis has to be performed in a gait laboratory, which is inaccessible for a large population and cannot provide natural gait measures. In this paper, we present a novel sensor device, namely, Smart Insole, to tackle the challenge of efficient gait monitoring in real life. An array of electronic textile (eTextile)-based pressure sensors are integrated in the insole to fully measure the plantar pressure. Smart Insole is also equipped with a low-cost inertial measurement unit including a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope, and a three-axis magnetometer to capture the gait characteristics in motion. Smart Insole can offer precise acquisition of gait information. Meanwhile, it is lightweight, thin, and comfortable to wear, providing an unobtrusive way to perform the gait monitoring. Furthermore, a smartphone graphic user interface is developed to display the sensor data in real-time via Bluetooth low energy. We perform a set of experiments in four real-life scenes including hallway walking, ascending/descending stairs, and slope walking, where gait parameters and features are extracted. Finally, the limitation and improvement, wearability and usability, further work, and healthcare-related potential applications are discussed. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	126
77	Smart Anomaly Prediction in Nonstationary CT Colonography Screening	To enhance the quality of economically efficient healthcare, we propose a preventive planning service for next-generation screening based on a longitudinal prediction. This newly proposed framework may bring important advancements in prevention by identifying the early stages of cancer, which will help in further diagnoses and initial treatment planning. The preventive service may also solve the obstacles of cost and availability of scanners in screening. For nonstationary medical data, anomaly detection is the key problem in the prediction of cancer staging. To address anomaly detection in a huge stream of databases, we applied a composite kernel to the prediction of cancer staging for the first time. The proposed longitudinal analysis of composite kernels (LACK) is designed for the prediction of anomaly status and cancer stage for further diagnosis and the future likelihood of cancer stage progression. The prediction error of LACK is relatively small even if the prediction is made far ahead of time. The computation time for nonstationary learning is reduced by 33% compared with stationary learning. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
78	Fall Recovery Subactivity Recognition with RGB-D Cameras	Accidental falls have been identified as a cause of mortality for elders who live alone around the globe. Following a fall, additional injury can be sustained if proper fall recovery techniques are not followed. These secondary complications can be reduced if the person had access to safe recovery procedures or were assisted, either by a person or a robot. We propose a framework for in situ robotic assistance for post fall recovery scenarios. In order to assist autonomously robots need to recognize an individual's posture and subactivities (e.g., falling, rolling, move to hands and knees, crawling, and push up through legs, sitting or standing). Human body skeleton tracking through RGB-D pose estimation methods fail to identify the body parts during key phases of fall recovery due to high occlusion rates in fallen, and recovering, postures. To address this issue, we investigated how low-level image features can be leveraged to recognize an individual's subactivities. Depth cuboid similarity features (DCSFs) approach was improved with M-partitioned histograms of depth cuboid prototypes, integration of activity progression direction, and outlier spatiotemporal interest point removal. Our modified DCSF algorithm was evaluated on a unique RGB-D multiview dataset, achieving 87.43 ± 1.74% accuracy in the extensive 3003 (C15/10 ) combinations of training-test groups of 15 subjects in 10 trials. This result was significantly larger than the nearest competitor, and faster in the training phase. This work could lead to more accurate in situ robotic assistance for fall recovery, saving lives for victims of falls. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	30

80	Toward Distributed Data Processing on Intelligent Leak-Points Prediction in Petrochemical Industries	Focusing on the leak-points in petrochemical industries, this paper discusses the key factors (i.e., equipment temperature, gas pressure, and diffusion rate) in petrochemical industries. Data from sensors of petrochemical industries need to be timely operated because of time sensitivity and it is hard to achieve associated information from sensors located in production sites. To this end, we propose a three-level framework based on improved back propagation (TLBP). The real-time data streams are processed according to the arriving time in input layer. At the same time, a neuron-optimizing solution is introduced in learning process to deal with redundant and invalid neurons, thereby accelerating the response speed of learning and reducing the prediction time. Finally, we propose an improved mechanism of the multidimensional learning factor to lower the learning error and higher convergence rate. Meanwhile, to fulfill the distributed prediction on leak-points, we see one three-level data-processing unit as a logic machine with multiple operators. Using the assignment scheduling, the general scheduling problem is split into the common subproblem of every operator and the system overhead is reduced. With the processed data we can obtain the relative location or diffusion radius of leak-points, as well as the area of leak-points. Simulation results show that the TLBP performs better than related algorithms in different metrics. Besides, the adaptability of TLBP is verified in leak-points prediction of petrochemical equipment from the processed data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	30
81	Conceptualization and Experimental Deployment of an Adaptive Synchronized Sensing System for Power Line Thermal Monitoring	Synchronized sensing offered by wide area measurement systems (WAMSs) enables advanced investigations on modern electrical power systems not performable before their advent. One of them is overhead lines (OHL) temperature monitoring, which can be implemented in WAMS industrial domains thanks to the availability of newly accessible sensing information provided by phasor measurement units (PMUs). To accomplish this task, a proper sensing-based integrated intellectualization is necessary in order to face with the major WAMS issues and challenges. In line with these considerations, this paper proposes an advanced computing framework for real-time conductor temperature monitoring of fully transposed OHLs that is able to overcome the aforementioned challenges and issues. The validity and effectiveness of the conceptualized solution is verified via field tests on an Italian transmission line currently in operation. The obtained outcomes led the Italian Transmission System Operator (TSO) to equip its own Energy Management System (EMS) with the deployed solution. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
82	Large-Scale Online Multitask Learning and Decision Making for Flexible Manufacturing	Large-scale machine coordination is a primary approach for flexible manufacturing, enabling large-scale autonomous machines to dynamically coordinate their actions in pursuit of a custom task. One of the key challenges for such large-scale systems is finding high-dimensional coordination decision-making policies. Multitask policy gradient algorithms can be used in search of high-dimensional policies, particularly in collaborative decision support systems and distributed control systems. However, it is difficult for these algorithms to learn online high-dimensional coordination control policies (CCP) from large-scale custom manufacturing tasks. This paper proposes a large-scale online multitask learning and decision-making approach, which can consecutively learn high-dimensional CCP in order to quickly coordinate machine actions online for large-scale custom manufacturing task. A large-scale online multitask leaning algorithm is developed, which is able to learn large-scale high-dimensional CCP in a flexible manufacturing scenario. An online stochastic planning algorithm is proposed, which online optimizes the Markov network structure in order to avoid expensive global search for the optimal policy. Experiments have been undertaken using a professional flexible manufacturing testbed deployed within a smart factory of Weichai Power in China. Results show the proposed approach to be more efficient when compared with previous works. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24
83	Network Admission Control Solution for 6LoWPAN Networks Based on Symmetric Key Mechanisms	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a promising technology for several industrial and quotidian applications. IPv6 is the most consensual solution to connect such networks to the Internet, and 6LoWPAN is the adaptation layer to run IPv6 over WSNs. Self-organization and self-configuration are key characteristics of WSN because they minimize the network configuration efforts and simultaneously increase the network robustness but they can also be exploited to perform security attacks. This paper proposes a network admission control solution for 6LoWPAN WSN that prevents unauthorized nodes from using the network to communicate either with the legitimate nodes and with the Internet, reducing in this way the security attacks that can be performed. The proposed solution includes node presence detection and authentication, administrative node authorization, and data filtering to discard frames from/to unauthorized nodes. It uses the standard 6LoWPAN neighbor discovery and RPL protocols, minimizing the number of additional required control messages. It includes cryptographic mechanisms, based on the AES symmetric key algorithm, to guarantee node authenticity and integrity, source authenticity, and data freshness of data frames. This paper also presents the design and deployment of a laboratory testbed validating the proposed network admission control solution. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
84	Modeling Lane Keeping by a Hybrid Open-Closed-Loop Pulse Control Scheme	This paper presents a novel methodology for modeling human lane keeping control by characterizing a unique concept of elementary steering pulses, which are motor primitives in man-vehicle systems. The novelty of the paper is the introduction of elementary steering pulses that have been evidently extracted from naturalistic driving data through machine learning techniques (data-driven modeling), and are incorporated into an alternative steering control scheme. This newly proposed hybrid-open-closed-loop control scheme starts an elementary steering pulse with an open-loop steering actuation, representing real human's reflex responses triggered by human lane keeping errors, and adjusts it back with the traditional closed-loop control. This shows a significant improvement on both the stability and the matching performance to real driving events. Online measurement of the key metrics in the steering process provides a new tool for monitoring driver states, and the biofidelic steering model may provide human-like qualities for future automated lane keeping systems. Both will add to the array of tools available for achieving autonomous and semiautonomous driving systems, which greatly benefits the current vehicle industry. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	32
85	EM-Psychiatry: An Ambient Intelligent System for Psychiatric Emergency	The proliferation of the market in patient care services is attracting attention in the healthcare industry; however, a remote mental healthcare system is still unattainable. In this paper, an ambient intelligent system of in-home psychiatric care service for emergency psychiatry (EM-psychiatry) is proposed for the remote monitoring of psychiatric emergency patients. The emergency psychiatric states of patients are modeled as the states of the maximum-entropy Markov model (MEMM), in which sensor observations, psychiatric screening scores, and patients' histories are considered as the observations of MEMM. A modified Viterbi, a machine-learning algorithm, is used to generate the most probable psychiatric state sequence based on such observations; then, from the most likely psychiatric state sequence, the emergency psychiatric state is predicted through the proposed algorithm. The ambient EM-psychiatry model is implemented and the performance of the proposed prediction model is analyzed using the receiver operator characteristics curves, which demonstrates that the use of the EM-psychiatric screening questionnaire with biosensor observations enhances the prediction accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
86	Self-Adaptive Data Collection and Fusion for Health Monitoring Based on Body Sensor Networks	In the past few years, wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs) emerged as a low-cost solution for healthcare applications. In WBSNs, biosensors collect periodically physiological measurement and send them to the coordinator where the data fusion process takes place. However, processing the huge amount of data captured by the limited lifetime biosensors and taking the right decisions when there is an emergency are major challenges in WBSNs. In this paper, we introduce a biosensor data management framework, starting from data collection to decision making. First, we propose an adaptive data collection approach on the biosensor node level. This approach uses an early warning score system to optimize data transmission and estimates in real time the sensing frequency. Second, we present a data fusion model on the coordinator level using a decision matrix and fuzzy set theory. To evaluate our approach, we conducted multiple series of simulations on real sensor data. The results show that our approach reduces the amount of collected data, while maintaining data integrity. In addition, we show the impact of sampling and filtering data on the accuracy of the taken decisions and compare our data fusion approach with a basic decision tree algorithm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	88
87	Improving Nonintrusive Load Monitoring Efficiency via a Hybrid Programing Method	Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate the total power consumption profile measured at the household power inlet into device-level insights. While many studies focus on the modeling methodologies, few of them address the challenge of the computation efficiency which is critical for practical applications. The NILM problem is essentially a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard problem, meaning that obtaining the exact optimal solution is technically intractable. This paper proposes a fast method to address the approximation to the solutions of such problems from an optimization point of view. It is shown that by taking advantage of the constraint programing framework, the computational efficiency of the proposed NILM scheme can be significantly improved while comparable solution accuracy can also be preserved. Simulations conducted on the popular public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	66
88	Intelligent Forecasting Using Dead Reckoning with Dynamic Errors	A method for integrating, processing, and analyzing sensing data from vehicle-mounted sensors for intelligent forecasting and decision-making is introduced. This dead reckoning with dynamic errors (DRWDEs) is for a large-scale integration of distributed resources and sensing data intervehicle collision avoidance system. This sensor fusion algorithm is introduced to predict the future trajectory of a vehicle. Current systems that predict a vehicle's future trajectory, necessary in a network of collision avoidance systems, tend to have a lot of errors when the vehicles are moving in a nonstraight path. Our system has been designed with the objective of improving the estimations during curves. To evaluate this system, our research uses a Garmin 16HVS GPS sensor, an AutoEnginuity OBDII ScanTool, and a Crossbow three-axis accelerometer. Using Kalman filters (KFs), a dynamic noise covariance matrix merged together with an interacting multiple models (IMMs) system, our DRWDE produces the future position estimation of where the vehicle will be 3 s later in time. The ability to handle the change in noise, depending on unavailable sensor measurements, permits a flexibility to use any type of sensor and still have the system run at the fastest frequency available. Compared with a more common KF implementation that runs at the rate of its slowest sensor (1 Hz in our setup), our experimental results showed that our DRWDE (running at 10 Hz) yielded more accurate predictions (25%-50% improvement) during abrupt changes in the heading of the vehicle. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
89	A Flexible Surgical Robotic System for Removal of Early-Stage Gastrointestinal Cancers by Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection	Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an effective and less invasive treatment for early gastric and colorectal cancers. Nevertheless, performing ESD through a flexible endoscope is technically challenging due to the limited controllability of the endoscopic instruments. Therefore, a surgical robotic system with high dexterity and better ergonomics is much needed. A master-slave dual-arm robot with customizing workspace for ESD is proposed for this study. The design is such that the procedure is completed without the need for changing the instrument. Our robot is mainly driven by tendon-sheath (TS) mechanism. Modeling and use of a controller for elongation compensation of tendon due to friction to increase position control accuracy are presented. Experiment shows that the controller greatly enhances the controllability of the robot. We have demonstrated that the design of the robot arm allows it to lift up to 48 g, which is sufficient for ESD. Six subjects, including three endoscopists and upper gastrointestinal surgeons, were invited to evaluate the system in an ex vivo experiment. Experienced surgeons were able to complete a dissection within 30 min. We have demonstrated a prototype robot that can facilitate the ESD procedure with bimanual tissue dissection. The system is competent to remove a lesion area precisely. Further studies are needed to evaluate the system in vivo. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	33
90	The application of DOA estimation approach in patient tracking systems with high patient density	In this paper, an improved localization method named three-uniform-linear-array localization is proposed for patient track systems. Three receivers adopting a smart antenna technique cooperate with each other to locate the patients using the angulation positioning method. In order to be able to track patients in environment with high patient density, a high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm for the coexistence of noncircular and circular signals is proposed. First, the maximal and common noncircularity rated signals are preliminarily estimated. Second, based on the noise space block matrix, the DOAs of these signals are re-estimated with high accuracy. Then, the covariance matrix of the maximal and common noncircularity rated signals is reconstructed. The contributions of these signals are eliminated after performing a subtraction operation on the covariance matrix of the received data and only those of circular signals remain. Finally, the DOAs of circular signals are obtained. Results of simulations and real tests demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	63
91	Multiple region of interest coverage in camera sensor networks for tele-intensive care units	Camera sensor networks (CSNs) are gradually being used in a tele-intensive care unit (tele-ICU), providing useful patient information to remote intensivists. Intensivists wish to focus on different regions of interest (RoIs) containing their patients. We consider a situation where preinstalled camera sensors' locations remain static and they can change the fields of view only by rotating orientations, while the RoIs are dynamically changed in location and size because of changes in the number of patients and care unit configuration. Therefore, an important issue is how to enhance the coverage of these RoIs by controlling the camera sensors' orientations. Previous studies on coverage optimization either focus on single area coverage or point(s) coverage. However, ignoring those multiple RoIs or simply treating them as points can cause unwanted coverage, resulting in performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate a novel multiple RoI coverage (MRC) problem in a CSN-based tele-ICU, aiming to maximize the lowest coverage ratio of all RoIs. The MRC problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard, so we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm MRC-Priority to solve it. We have implemented a CSN testbed to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm.

92	On cost-efficient sensor placement for contaminant detection in water distribution systems	In recent years, water pollution or contamination incidents happened frequently, causing serious disasters and negative social impact. To reduce the water contamination risk, water quality monitoring sensors should be deployed in water distribution system (WDS) to enable real-time pollution detection. It is desirable to deploy sensors everywhere so that any contamination event can be detected and reported in a timely manner. Unfortunately, this is a luxury and unrealistic vision because of high deployment cost. It is significant to lower the deployment cost provided that the quality-of-sensing, e.g., coverage and contamination detection time, can be guaranteed for effective depollution action. In this paper, we consider a water quality monitoring sensor network consisting of two kinds of sensors with different prices. The expensive one is of cellular communication capability and therefore is able to send sensing information to control center directly, while the cheaper one is of only sensor-to-sensor communication capability. We investigate a cost-efficient sensor deployment problem on how to deploy these two kinds of sensors in a given WDS to minimize the deployment cost, without violating the quality-of-sensing requirement. We first formulate the problem into a mixed integer quadratically constrained programming problem, which is then linearized into an equivalent mixed integer linear programming. We further propose a polynomial two-stage heuristic algorithm and evaluate its efficiency via extensive simulation-based studies. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	41
93	A Higher Energy-Efficient Sampling Scheme for Networked Control Systems over IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Networks	This paper proposes a higher energy-efficient mixed sampling scheme (MSE) for networked control systems (NCSs) over IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks. Compared with some existing periodic event-Triggered sampling (ETS) schemes with a delayed sampling estimation, this delay is no longer existing in MSE since there is a dynamic adjustable threshold in MSE to compensate for this delay. Compared with some existing self-Triggered sampling (STS)/ETS schemes, MSE does not require continuous measurement of the system states and does not suffer from the conservativeness induced by a self-Triggered estimation. By using the proposed MSE, one can improve the energy efficiency in energy-constrained wireless NCSs (WiNCSs) by reducing the number of transmitted packets and increasing the idle-listening period of wireless sensor nodes. An inverted pendulum (Feedback 33-005-PCI) controlled over IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	61
94	Resilient Control of Networked Control System under DoS Attacks: A Unified Game Approach	We consider the problem of resilient control of networked control system (NCS) under denial-of-service (DoS) attack via a unified game approach. The DoS attacks lead to extra constraints in the NCS, where the packets may be jammed by a malicious adversary. Considering the attack-induced packet dropout, optimal control strategies with multitasking and central-tasking structures are developed using game theory in the delta domain, respectively. Based on the optimal control structures, we propose optimality criteria and algorithms for both cyber defenders and DoS attackers. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	216
95	Network-Based Fault Detection Filter and Controller Coordinated Design for Unmanned Surface Vehicles in Network Environments	This paper is concerned with the network-based modeling, and observer-based fault detection filter (FDF) and controller coordinated design for an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in network environments. Network-based models for the USV subject to actuator faults and wave-induced disturbances are established for the first time by introducing an observer-based FDF, and considering network-induced characteristics such as delays and packet dropouts in the sampler-to-control station communication network channel and the control station-to-actuator communication network channel. Based on these models, network-based FDF and controller coordinated design criteria are derived to asymptotically stabilize the residual system. The designed network-based FDF and controller can guarantee the sensitivity of the residual signal to faults and the robustness of the USV to external disturbances. Fault detection performance analysis verifies the effectiveness of the proposed network-based FDF and controller coordinated design scheme for the USV in network environments. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	105
96	On the Use of IEEE 802.11n for Industrial Communications	In the last years, IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs (WLANs) have proved their effectiveness for a wide range of real-time industrial communication applications. Nonetheless, the introduction of the important IEEE 802.11n amendment, which is commonly implemented in commercial devices, has not been adequately addressed in this operational framework yet. IEEE 802.11n encompasses several enhancements at both physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers that may bring considerable improvements to the performance of WLANs deployed in real-time industrial communication systems. To this regard, in this paper, we present a thorough investigation of the most important IEEE 802.11n features, addressing in particular, specific performance indicators such as timeliness and reliability, which are crucial for industrial communication systems. To this aim, after an accurate theoretical analysis, we implemented a suitable experimental setup and carried out several measurement sessions to obtain an exhaustive performance assessment. The outcomes of these experiments, on one hand, revealed that the adoption of IEEE 802.11n can actually provide significant improvements to the performance of the IEEE 802.11 WLAN in the industrial communication scenario. On the other hand, the assessment allowed to select, among the various options of IEEE 802.11n, the parameter settings which may ensure the best behavior in this specific (and demanding) field of application. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	78

98	Energy Management for Joint Operation of CHP and PV Prosumers Inside a Grid-Connected Microgrid: A Game Theoretic Approach	This paper mainly focuses on the energy management of microgrids (MGs) consisting of combined heat and power (CHP) and photovoltaic (PV) prosumers. A multiparty energy management framework is proposed for joint operation of CHP and PV prosumers with the internal price-based demand response. In particular, an optimization model based on Stackelberg game is designed, where the microgrid operator (MGO) acts as the leader and PV prosumers are the followers. The properties of the game are studied and it is proved that the game possesses a unique Stackelberg equilibrium. The heuristic algorithm based on differential evolution is proposed that can be adopted by the MGO, and nonlinear constrained programing can be adopted by each prosumer to reach the Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, via a practical example, the effectiveness of the model is verified in terms of determining MGO's prices and optimizing net load characteristic, etc. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	198
99	IPRP - The Parallel Redundancy Protocol for IP Networks: Protocol Design and Operation	Reliable packet delivery within stringent delay constraints is of paramount importance to mission-critical computer applications with hard real-time constraints. Because retransmission and coding techniques counteract the delay requirements, reliability may be achieved through replication over multiple fail-independent paths. The existing solutions, such as the parallel redundancy protocol (PRP), replicate all packets at the media access control layer over parallel paths. PRP works best in local area networks; however, it is not viable for IP networks that are a key element of emerging mission-critical systems. This limitation, coupled with diagnostic inability and lack of security, renders PRP unsuitable for reliable data delivery in these IP networks. To address this issue, we present a transport-layer solution: the IP parallel redundancy protocol (iPRP). Designing iPRP poses nontrivial challenges in the form of selective packet-replication, and soft-state and multicast support. iPRP replicates only time-critical unicast or multicast user datagram protocol traffic. iPRP requires no modifications to the existing monitoring application, end-device operating system, or to the intermediate network devices. It only requires a simple software installation on the end devices. iPRP has a set of diagnostic tools for network debugging. With our implementation of iPRP in Linux, we show that iPRP supports multiple flows with minimal processing-and-delay overhead. It is being installed in our campus smart-grid network and is publicly available. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
100	Scheduling for Source Relaying with Packet Aggregation in Industrial Wireless Networks	The interest in wireless communication systems for industrial applications has grown significantly over the last years. More flexible, easier to install and maintain, wireless networks present a promising alternative to the currently used wired systems. However, reliability and timeliness requirements at present met by wired networks also need to be fulfilled by wireless solutions. Packet errors introduced when packets travel through wireless channels imply a significant challenge to fulfill these requirements. Relaying has been recognized to improve the reliability in industrial wireless networks without causing additional delay. Furthermore, the recent results have shown that relaying combined with packet aggregation significantly outperforms simple relaying. However, it is not always cost efficient to introduce additional relay nodes into an industrial network and hence, in this paper, we propose using a combination of relaying and packet aggregation at the source nodes. The results show that when relaying and aggregation are used at the source nodes, the transmission schedule plays a crucial role. A schedule adapting to the varying channel conditions improves performance substantially. By carefully choosing which packet to aggregate, even further improvements can be achieved. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25
101	RESTful Industrial Communication with OPC UA	Representational state transfer (REST) is a wide-spread architecture style for decentralized applications. REST proposes the use of a fixed set of service interfaces to transfer heterogeneous resource representations instead of defining custom interfaces for individual applications. This paper explores the advantages of RESTful architectures, i.e., service-oriented software architectures comprised RESTful services, in industrial settings. These include communication advantages such as reduced communication overhead and the possibility to introduce caching layers, and system design advantages including stable service interfaces across applications and the use of resource-oriented information models in cyber-physical systems. Additionally, a RESTful extension to the open platform communications (OPC) unified architecture (OPC UA) binary protocol is proposed in order to leverage these advantages. It requires only minimal modifications to the existing OPC UA stacks and is fully backward compatible with the standard protocol. Performance benchmarks on industrial hardware show a throughput increase up to a factor of eight for short-lived interactions. This reduction of overhead is especially relevant for the use of OPC UA in the emerging Industrial Internet of Things. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	85
102	Distributed Antiflocking Algorithms for Dynamic Coverage of Mobile Sensor Networks	Mobile sensor networks (MSNs) are often used for monitoring large areas of interest (AoI) in remote and hostile environments, which can be highly dynamic in nature. Due to the infrastructure cost, MSNs usually consist of a limited number of sensor nodes. In order to cover large AoI, the mobile nodes have to move in an environment while monitoring the area dynamically. MSNs that are controlled by most of the previously proposed dynamic coverage algorithms either lack adaptability to dynamic environments or display poor coverage performances due to considerable overlapping of sensing coverage. As a new class of emergent motion control algorithms for MSNs, antiflocking control algorithms enable MSNs to self-organize in an environment and provide impressive dynamic coverage performances. The antiflocking algorithms are inspired by the solitary behavior of some animals who try to separate from their species in most of daily activities in order to maximize their own gains. In this paper, we propose two distributed antiflocking algorithms for dynamic coverage of MSNs, one for obstacle-free environments and the other for obstacle-dense environments. Both are based on the sensing history and local interactions among sensor nodes. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	37
103	The Hierarchical Smart Home Cyberattack Detection Considering Power Overloading and Frequency Disturbance	The concept of smart home has recently gained significant popularity. Despite that it offers improved convenience and cost reduction, the prevailing smart home infrastructure suffers from vulnerability due to cyberattacks. It is possible for hackers to launch cyberattacks at the community level while causing a large area power system blackout through cascading effects. In this paper, the cascading impacts of two cyberattacks on the predicted dynamic electricity pricing are analyzed. In the first cyberattack, the hacker manipulates the electricity price to form peak energy loads such that some transmission lines are overloaded. Those transmission lines are then tripped and the power system is separated into isolated islands due to the cascading effect. In the second cyberattack, the hacker manipulates the electricity price to increase the fluctuation of the energy load to interfere the frequency of the generators. The generators are then tripped by the protective procedures and cascading outages are induced in the transmission network. The existing technique only tackles overloading cyberattack while still suffering from the severe limitation in scalability. Therefore, based on partially observable Markov decision processes, a hierarchical detection framework exploring community decomposition and global policy optimization is proposed in this work. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed hierarchical computing technique can effectively and efficiently detect those cyberattacks, achieving the detection accuracy of above 98%, while improving the scalability. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
104	Distributed Control Scheme for Package-Level State-of-Charge Balancing of Grid-Connected Battery Energy Storage System	For the battery energy storage system (BESS) consisting of multiple battery packages, package-level state-of-charge (SOC) balancing can provide safety redundancy in protecting battery packages from overcharging or overdischarging, and maintain the maximum power capacity of the overall BESS. In this paper, a distributed control scheme is proposed for package-level SOC balancing of a grid-connected BESS. The proposed control scheme comprises three parts. First, each battery package shares its SOC with its neighboring battery packages over the communication network. Based on the SOCs of its own and its neighbors, each battery package is equipped with an energy coordinator. Second, for each battery package, a distributed observer is employed to estimate the average desired power output, which is used to determine the local reference power output together with the energy coordinator. Third, local current controller is synthesized for each battery package to achieve local reference power output tracking. Comprehensive case studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	48
105	Automatic Packing Mechanism for Simplification of the Scheduling in Profinet IRT	In order to support very small cycle times, Profinet isochronous real-time (IRT) was improved by implementing the dynamic frame packing (DFP) mechanism. It turned out that DFP is relatively efficient, but it still has two crucial drawbacks. The complex scheduling has to be recalculated every time the network structure is modified. Furthermore, DFP only operates efficiently in line topology. This study presents a proposal for further improvements of Profinet IRT by implementing an automatic packing mechanism (APM). The main advantage of APM lies in the fact that a dedicated scheduling algorithm is not required. Furthermore, APM achieves approximately the same performance as DFP in line topology, but it has a distinctive advance in star or tree topologies. This paper also presents experimental validation results that prove the functionality of the approach. APM could be implemented with only minor modifications of the media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) hardware to improve the flexibility of Profinet IRT. © 2015 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
106	Implementation of a Hybrid Distributed/Centralized Real-Time Monitoring System for a DC/AC Microgrid with Energy Storage Capabilities	This paper proposes a combined distributed/centralized architecture for the control and monitoring of a hybrid dc/ac microgrid (MG) with energy storage capabilities. The monitoring system is based on an own developed C++ framework for the measurement and real-time state estimation of the MG. Calculations running at sampled values frequency (10 kHz) are implemented into a set of distributed measurement and processing units, which have a TCP/IP communication link with a central server running the power flow algorithm.

The proposed system includes the hardware and software architecture for the monitoring of the MG, the communications scheme, the implementation of real-time algorithms for grid state estimation, a graphical user interface including different visualization alternatives, and data storing/retrieving capabilities. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	31
107	Load Frequency Control with Communication Topology Changes in Smart Grid	In this paper, the quality of service of communication infrastructure implemented in multiarea power system for load frequency control application is assessed in smart grid environment. In this study, network induced effects time delay, packet loss, bandwidth, quantization, and change in communication topology (CT) has been addressed to examine the system performance in closed loop. Uncertainty in time delay is approximated using deterministic and stochastic models. The network is modeled considering different network configurations, i.e., change in CT. The modeled communication network guarantees control relevant properties, i.e., stability. The decentralized controller and linear matrix inequality-based linear quadratic regulator is implemented to reduce the dynamic performance (mean square error of states variables) of power system as CT changes. Simulation results suggest that the proposed scheme of networked control is superior with respect to other design methods available in the literature, and thus robust to communication imperfections. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	76
108	Integrating Dynamic-TDMA Communication Channels into COTS Ethernet Networks	Real-time Ethernet (RTE) is widely recognized for its potential to provide a unified communication backbone for next-generation heterogeneous distributed systems. However, most of the existing research in RTE technologies has traditionally focused on formal models and theoretical analyzes of timing properties, usually omitting the associated implementation challenges for testing them in practice. This gap between theory and practice prevents experimental validation of the claimed properties, which in turn hinders the pace of innovation and adoption of the technology in industrial settings. This paper aims at narrowing the theory-practice gap by characterizing a comprehensive open-source RTE framework that explores emerging challenges in real-time networking, including the provision of ultra-low latency and jitter, dynamic bandwidth management, and segmentation within large networks. This work integrates research on formal abstractions for dynamic time-division multiple access arbitration and technological insights from modern hardware infrastructure, and uses a representative distributed video processing application to provide reproducible evidence of the achieved properties in multihop Ethernet settings. By leveraging readily available technology and an open-source design, the proposed framework facilitates further exploration and experimental validation of properties that are beyond the scope of current commercial technologies, encouraging evidence-based discussions to accelerate development and adoption of new standards for next-generation industrial networks. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
109	Using Two Independent Channels with Gateway for FlexRay Static Segment Scheduling	The FlexRay bus is a communication standard used in the automotive industry. It offers a deterministic message transmission in the static segment following a time-triggered schedule. Even if its bandwidth is ten times higher than the bandwidth of controller area network (CAN), its throughput limits are going to be reached in high-class car models soon. A solution that could postpone this problem is to use an efficient scheduling algorithm that exploits both channels of the FlexRay. The significant and often neglected feature that can theoretically double the bandwidth is the possibility to use two independent communication channels that can intercommunicate through the gateway. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm that decomposes the scheduling problem to the electronic control unit (ECU)-to-channel assignment subproblem, which decides which channel the ECUs should be connected to and the channel scheduling subproblem that creates static segment communication schedules for both channels. The algorithm is able to create a schedule for cases where channels are configured in the independent mode, as well as in the fault-tolerant mode or in cases where just part of the signals are fault tolerant. Finally, the algorithm is evaluated on real data and synthesized data, and the relation between the portion of fault-tolerant signals and the number of allocated slots is presented. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	17
110	A Probabilistic Approach to Determine Optimal Capacity and Location of Electric Vehicles Parking Lots in Distribution Networks	In this paper, a probabilistic approach based on the point estimate method is presented to determine the optimal capacity and location of electric vehicles (EVs) parking lots in distribution networks. For this purpose, uncertain parameters in driving patterns of vehicle owners are considered, and the effects of these uncertainties on determination of optimal capacity and profit from the construction of parking lots have been investigated. The proposed approach has considered both technical and economical aspects simultaneously. Additionally, because of the necessity of optimal schedule and the determination of EV charging and discharging time intervals to calculate the benefits of the amount of parking lot power exchange with a distribution network and EVs, a new approach is proposed to charge schedule of EVs. This method runtime, in addition to simple mechanism and global optimal responses, is very short. Finally, the presented probabilistic method is performed on two test distribution networks and obtained results are discussed. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	82
111	Social-oriented adaptive transmission in opportunistic internet of smartphones	Stable and reliable wireless communication is one of the critical demands for smart cities to connect people and devices. Although intelligent terminals can be leveraged to deliver and exchange data through Internet, poor network coverage and expensive network access challenge the deployment of network infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a social-oriented smartphone-based adaptive transmission mechanism to improve the network connectivity and throughput in Internet of Things (IoTs) for smart cities. First, a social-oriented double-auction-based relay selection scheme is investigated to stimulate the relay smartphones to forward packets for others so that the network connectivity can be strengthened. Furthermore, for the sake of achieving high throughput in smartphone-based IoTs, the relay method selection is determined by integrating various kinds of transmission schemes in an optimal fashion to make full use of wireless spectrum resource. Due to its high computational complexity, a firefly-algorithm-based scheme is investigated, by which the formulated NP-complete problem can be solved effectively. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	82
112	Agent and cyber-physical system based self-organizing and self-adaptive intelligent shopfloor	The increasing demand of customized production results in huge challenges to the traditional manufacturing systems. In order to allocate resources timely according to the production requirements and to reduce disturbances, a framework for the future intelligent shopfloor is proposed in this paper. The framework consists of three primary models, namely the model of smart machine agent, the self-organizing model, and the self-adaptive model. A cyber-physical system for manufacturing shopfloor based on the multiagent technology is developed to realize the above-mentioned function models. Gray relational analysis and the hierarchy conflict resolution methods were applied to achieve the self-organizing and self-adaptive capabilities, thereby improving the reconfigurability and responsiveness of the shopfloor. A prototype system is developed, which has the adequate flexibility and robustness to configure resources and to deal with disturbances effectively.

113	Improved Gaussian Mixture Regression Based on Pseudo Feature Generation Using Bootstrap in Blood Pressure Estimation	Although the systolic and diastolic blood pressure ratios (SBPRs and DBPRs) based on the conventional maximum amplitude algorithm (MAA) are assumed to be fixed; this assumption is not valid. In this paper, we present an improved Gaussian mixture regression (IGMR) approach that can accurately measure blood pressure. The SBPR and DBPR are estimated by using the IGMR technique. Specifically, the number of feature's samples in the clustered feature space is increased using the nonparametric bootstrap technique to create the pseudo feature. The pseudo feature vector is much more matched than the original feature for the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to fit individual BP characteristics in the training stage. By using the classified targeting clusters, we eventually estimate the SBPR and DBPR based on the IGMR technique at the test stage. The mean error (ME) and standard deviation of the error (SDE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of the SBP and DBP estimates obtained with the SBPR and DBPR using the proposed technique approaches are superior to the ME, SDE, and MAE of the estimates obtained using the conventional methods. The difference in the SDE between the proposed technique and the conventional MAA technique for the SBP and DBP turned out to be 3.67 and 3.08 mmHg in the simulation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	33
114	Exploiting mm-wave communications to boost the performance of industrial wireless networks	This work explores the potentiality of millimeter waves (mmW) as physical layer in industrial wireless networks. Innovative models and a link design method are proposed to achieve reliable communication, at a distance of tens of meters for a single hop, even in harsh environments. By exploiting the worldwide-free band of several GHz, available around 60 GHz, mmW links allow to achieve a performance boosting of up to two orders of magnitude, w.r.t. conventional sub-6-GHz wireless links, in indoor industrial environments. Time slotted channel hopping and frequency-diversity can be implemented with a large number of channels, and with high bit rate (several Mb/s per channel). This allows for robust networking of high data-rate sensors, such as cameras, radars, or laser scanners. Featuring a low bit error rate, mmW communication allows for low-latency link and large number of hops in networks with a large radius. Finally, it ensures interference separation from operating frequencies of electrical machines, switching converters, and other industrial wireless networks (e.g., 802.11 or 802.15). Implementation results for key HWblocks in low-cost technologies show the feasibility of mmW communication nodes with low-power and compact size. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23
115	Multiagent system-based integrated solution for topology identification and state estimation	Traditional state estimation (SE) methods are usually implemented in a centralized way. The increased size, complexity of power systems, and the deregulation of the power industries result in the inefficiency of the conventional SE methods. Thus, improved SE solutions in terms of computational speed, easy implementation, and flexibility are urgently needed for future power systems. In this paper, a fully distributed integrated solution is proposed for multiarea topology identification (TI) and SE problems of power systems. Both problems are formulated as a weighted least square problem and solved with a distributed subgradient algorithm via multiagent systems. By applying statistical tests, the TI can identify network topology change accurately. The SE estimates the actual states based on the identified network topology. The proposed distributed solution can be implemented in a fully distributed way based on the flexible decomposition of power systems, and is able to obtain comparable estimated states as centralized methods.

116	Asynchronous and Selective transmission for dewiring of building management systems	In this paper, we show a design and implementation of a (partial) wireless building management system (BMS). Compared to the existing wired BMS, a wireless system can be much cheaper and more flexible in deployment. There are existing studies on smart and wireless BMS. Our design differs from others as the latter usually takes a re-arch approach and develops a brand new suite of protocols. However, it can take a considerably long time for re-standardization and adoption by vendors. Our design does not intend to tear down the full suite of upper layer protocols. We thus face difficulties as we need to maintain the upper layer protocols in operation and support their data traffic. The key ideas of our approach are an asynchronous-response framework to maintain the control plane of the upper layer protocols intact, and a modular design to prioritize and schedule data flow to handle link quality and throughput variations. We implemented the proposed design into a real system and evaluated the system by comprehensive experiments with real BMS controllers and software. In addition, we conducted a field deployment by integrating our system with the BMS in FG-building of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The system operated smoothly during 5-h deployment. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

However, similar to Ethernet, the availability of synchronized clocks to coordinate and control communication and distributed real-time services is not a built-in feature in WLAN. Over the years, this has led to the design and use of a wide variety of customized protocols with varying complexity and precision, both for wired and wireless networks, in accordance with the increasingly demanding requirements from real-time applications. This survey looks into the details of synchronization over IEEE 802.11 with a particular focus on the infrastructure mode which is most relevant for industrial use cases. It highlights the different parameters which affect the performance of clock synchronization over WLAN and compares the performance of existing synchronization methods to analyze their shortcomings.

Through exchanges of information, smart objects are capable of reasoning and generate higher level of intelligence. The effectiveness of data collection processes is a key factor to the success of IoT systems as it can seriously affect the freshness of the captured data. Efficient data collection processes have been well studied on sensory systems with static topologies and single data extraction point. Smart devices in IoT systems are often shared by different parties; therefore, concurrent data collection processes are always expected. Such a unique characteristic of IoT systems has imposed new challenges to the designs of efficient data collection processes. In this paper, concurrent data collection trees specifically designed for IoT applications are proposed. It is shown that, comparing with an existing single-user data collection structure, systems with the proposed tree structures can significantly shorten their concurrent data collection processes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	29
119	Ontology driven approach to generate distributed automation control from substation automation design	This paper proposes a method for the automatic generation of smart-grid automation systems software from specifications that includes physical system layout and domain-specific functional 'recipes.' The generated software has component organization and implements a decentralized approach to smart grid control, which reduces complexity of automation systems design and modification. The proposed method relies on synergies of two industrial standards IEC 61850 and IEC 61499, which are used to represent a part of the specification and the resulting software model, respectively. Then, the specification model is created in a form of ontology and the generation is based on ontology transformation. The proposed method requires an extension to the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to support the change of an ontology axioms set for the purpose of ontology transformation. The proposed transformation language, called extended SWRL, is introduced and illustrated in use. The result shows the viability of eSWRL as an ontology transformation language when demonstrated in a power distribution case study system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15
120	TDMA versus CSMA/CA for wireless multihop communications: A stochastic worst-case delay analysis	Wireless networks have become a very attractive solution for soft real-time data transport in the industry. For such technologies to carry real-time traffic, reliable bounds on end-to-end communication delays have to be ascertained to warrant a proper system behavior. As for legacy wired embedded and real-time networks, two main wireless multiple access methods can be leveraged: one is time division multiple access (TDMA), which follows a time-triggered paradigm, and the other is carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), which follows an event-triggered paradigm. This paper proposes an analytical comparison of the time behavior of two representative TDMA and CSMA/CA protocols in terms of the worst-case end-to-end delay. This worst-case delay is expressed in a probabilistic manner because our analytical framework captures the versatility of the wireless medium. Analytical delay bounds are obtained from delay distributions, which are compared to fine-grained simulation results. Exhibited study cases show that TDMA can offer smaller or larger worst-case bounds than CSMA/CA depending on its settings. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
121	Cyclist social force model at unsignalized intersections with heterogeneous traffic	Cycling is a typical green traffic mode, and takes a growing part of urban traffic volume. Yet limited cyclist behavior models shed light on cases at unsignalized intersections with heterogeneous traffic, where bicycle behavior is characterized by frequent confrontations with other road users (vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians). This study developed a microscopic simulation model for cyclist behavior analysis at unsignalized intersection with heterogeneous traffic. The cyclist crossing model applied fuzzy logic and social force theory for this purpose. The parameters are either estimated directly based on empirical data or derived indirectly through maximum likelihood estimation. Finally model performance was confirmed through comparisons between estimations and observations on individual trajectory, minimum distances, and average riding speeds of collision avoidance behaviors with different conflicting road users. Simulation results indicated that the model can represent cyclist crossing behavior at unsignalized intersection with heterogeneous traffic as in the real world. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	31
122	Performance modeling extension of directory facilitator for enhancing communication in FIPA-compliant multiagent systems	The growing adoption of highly distributed and intelligent industrial systems frequently denoted as Industry 4.0 or Industrial Internet of Things brings great opportunities as well as new research questions because connection of single devices into a cooperating community creates much larger and complex systems with new challenges regarding verification and security. This paper proposes a method to solve problems related to setup of timeouts used in communication protocols. The static setup is replaced with an enhancement of directory facilitator that in cooperation with a specialized sniffer agent continuously monitors the system load and eventually postpones starts of new tasks. This precaution eliminates saturation of computational resources and preserves the maximal reachable system performance. The proposed method is demonstrated through a simulation of a chilled water system using a test-bed of six minicomputers Raspberry Pi that host agents implemented in Jade. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
123	Understanding data heterogeneity in the context of cyber-physical systems integration	The current gradual adoption of the Industry 4.0 is the research trend that includes more intensive utilization of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). The computerization of manufacturing will bring many advantages but it is needed to face the heterogeneity problem during an integration of various CPSs for enabling this progress. In this paper, we describe various types of heterogeneity with emphasis to a semantic heterogeneity. The CPSs integration problem is classified into two different challenges. Next, we introduce the approach and the implementation of the semantic heterogeneity reduction with the focus on using Semantic Web technologies for a data integration. Then, the Big Data approach is described for facilitating the implementation. Finally, the possible solution is demonstrated on our proposed semantic Big Data historian. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	79

125	Toward self-manageable and adaptive industrial cyber-physical systems with knowledge-driven autonomic service management	An increasingly important goal of industrial automation systems is to continuously optimize physical resource utilization such as materials. Distributed automation is seen as one enabling technology for achieving this goal, in which networking controller nodes collaborate in a peer-to-peer way to form a new paradigm, namely industrial cyber-physical systems (iCPS). In order to achieve rapid response to changes from both high-level control systems and plant environment, the proposed self-manageable agent relies on the use of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) that improves flexibility and interoperability. It is enhanced by the autonomic service management (ASM) to implement software modifications in a fully automatic manner, thus achieving self-manageable and adaptive iCPS. The architecture design of the ASM is provided and integration with SOA-based execution environment is illustrated.

126	CrowdNavi: Demystifying last mile navigation with crowdsourced driving information	With detailed digital map of the transport network and even real-time traffic, today's navigation services provide good quality routes in the major route level. Once entering the last mile near the destination, they unfortunately can be ineffective and, instead, local drivers often have a better understanding of the routes there. With the deep penetration of 3G/4G mobile networks, drivers today are well connected anytime and anywhere; they can readily access information from the Internet and share information to the driver's community. This motivates our design of CrowdNavi, a complementary service to existing navigation systems, seeking to combat the last mile puzzle. CrowdNavi collects the crowdsourced driving information from users to identify their local driving patterns, and recommend the best local routes for users to reach their destinations. In this paper, we present the architectural design of CrowdNavi and identifies the unique challenges therein, particularly on identifying the last segment in a route from the crowdsourced driving information and navigate drivers through the last segment. We offer a complete set of algorithms to identify the last segment from the drivers' trajectories, scoring the landmark, and locating best routes with user preferences. We then present effective navigation algorithm to locate the best route along the landmarks for the last segment. We further realize the potential risks of attacks in crowdsourced systems and develop a multisensor cross-validation method against them. We have implemented the CrowdNavi app on Android mobile OS, and have examined its performance under various circumstances. The experimental results demonstrate its superiority in navigating drivers in the last segment toward the destination. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
127	Participatory Sensing for Smart Cities: A Case Study on Transport Trip Quality Measurement	"Participatory sensing (PS), an emerging sensing paradigm through organizing people and their mobile devices as sensors, is regarded as a promising solution to solve large-scale urban issues. PS has been implemented in many applications such as transportation, environmental monitoring, public health, etc. These applications are of high relevance for smart cities. Smart cities rely on the infrastructures established by government and industrial agencies to sense urban dynamics. PS can complement these infrastructures by involving ""human sensors"" and obtaining insights into people's activities. In this paper, the key features and challenges of PS are surveyed. A prototype PS platform is designed for efficient collection and management of smartphone sensing and survey data. A transport trip quality measurement system (TQMS) has been developed using this platform. Our experience to organize PS activities through a novel collaboration driven incentive mechanism is elucidated.

128	Theoretical and experimental evaluation of ethernet powerlink pollresponse chaining mechanism	Ethernet Powerlink (EPL) is an industrial Ethernet networking solution commonly used as a communication network in distributed control and automation systems ranging from simple I/O to highly complex motion control applications. The PollResponse Chaining (PRC) mechanism is a new EPL standard feature aimed at increasing the network performance when nodes exchange small amount of data, especially if they are connected in line topology. In this paper, we present a theoretical model suitable for assessing the real-time performance of the EPL protocol operating in both the standard and PRC mode for two basic topologies commonly found in real installations, line, and star. Moreover, we carried out a series of experiments on prototype networks in order to acquire the relevant timing parameters of the EPL network components required for the development of an OMNeT++ simulation model, which can be further exploited to evaluate the EPL protocol in the case of more complex scenarios. Finally, we propose a modification of the original PRC solution to improve its flexibility while allowing the same (or even higher) performance level. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated on a real prototype, whereas a certain performance gain over the original PRC mechanism was proved through simulations conducted on a more complex network structure. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
129	Fuzzy group-based intersection control via vehicular networks for smart transportations	Vehicular network has been recently used to achieve high efficient and flexible traffic scheduling at intersection roads for smart transportation systems. Different from existing works, where traffic signal is used to schedule waiting vehicles at each lane, we propose to divide vehicles in the same lane into small groups and schedule vehicle groups via wireless communication rather than traffic lights. Such direct scheduling of vehicles can reduce waiting time and improve fairness, especially when the traffic volume in different lanes is imbalanced. The key challenge in such a design lies in determining appropriate size of groups with respect to real-time traffic conditions. To cope with this issue, we propose a neuro-fuzzy network-based grouping mechanism, where the network is trained using reinforcement learning technique. Also, vehicle groups are scheduled via a neuro-fuzzy network. Simulations using ns3 are conducted to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it with similar works. The results show that our algorithm can reduce waiting time and at the same time improve fairness in various cases, and the advantage against traffic light algorithms can be up to 40%. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	36
130	Enhancing communication determinism in Wi-Fi networks for soft real-time industrial applications	Communication over the ether is by nature erratic, and thus wireless networks are often deemed unsuitable to support time-critical distributed control applications, like those at the shop-floor of industrial plants. However, scheduling techniques derived from real-time operating systems, along with channel redundancy and runtime retransmission management, can be profitably applied to wireless networks to improve their determinism tangibly. This paper presents a novel approach that combines such solutions. A preliminary prototype implementation, which relies on IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), has been set up to assess feasibility and performance of the approach. Results show that determinism of data exchange can be improved to a degree that makes wireless networks actually suitable for many soft real-time applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	40
131	Efficient ambiguity resolution in wireless localization systems	Wireless communication is widely used for node localization in various automation domains. Schemes based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) are a good compromise of achievable accuracy and implementation effort. Due to restrictions on possible reference sensor positions in industrial environments, the geometric conditions between reference and mobile nodes locations are often difficult. Consequently, iterative algorithms can fail or result in high computational effort. Exact direct methods introduce no additional errors, but can result in a valid pair of solutions. Existing direct methods thus either rely on a priori information to sort out one of those two solutions, or revert to nonexact linearization approaches of the underlying hyperbolic equations. In this work, we present a direct approach that applies exact direct methods, and resolves the ambiguous pairs of solutions without a priori information. Its divide and conquer structure and the high computational efficiency of the available exact direct methods makes it a very good candidate for fast parallel computing in distributed sensor networks. The performance is compared to the Cramer-Rao lower bound, to the iterative Gauss-Newton method and to another direct method. The new method is presented for the TDOA scheme, but can also be applied to time of arrival, or any other range-based scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
132	A dynamic rate selection algorithm for IEEE 802.11 industrial wireless LAN	The multirate support feature has been introduced by the IEEE 802.11 standard to improve the system performance, and has been widely exploited by means of rate adaptation (RA) strategies within general purpose wireless LANs. These strategies revealed ineffective for real-time industrial communications, and alternative solutions, better tailored for such a specific field of application, were investigated. The preliminary outcomes of the analyses carried out were promising, even if they clearly indicated that further efforts were necessary. In this direction, this paper first proposes rate selection for industrial networks (RSIN), an innovative RA algorithm specifically conceived for the real-time industrial scenario with the goal of minimizing the transmission error probability, while taking into account the deadline imposed to packet delivery. Then, it describes the practical implementation of RSIN on commercial devices, along with that of other formerly introduced RA techniques. Finally, the paper presents a thorough performance analysis, carried out to investigate the behavior of the addressed RA schemes. Such an assessment was performed via both experimental campaigns and simulations. The obtained results, on one hand, confirm the effectiveness of the RA techniques purposely designed for real-time industrial communication. On the other hand, they clearly indicate that RSIN outperforms all the other strategies. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	28
133	Experimental evaluation of seamless redundancy applied to industrial Wi-Fi networks	Seamless redundancy can be profitably exploited to improve predictability of wireless networks in general and, in particular, IEEE 802.11. According to this approach, packets are transmitted by senders on two (or more) channels at the same time and duplicate copies are discarded by receivers. As long as the behavior of physical channels is uncorrelated, communication quality improves noticeably, in terms of both transmission latencies and percentage of dropped frames. In this paper, communication over redundant links has been analyzed by means of a thorough experimental campaign, based on measurements carried out on real devices. Results confirm that, under typical operating conditions, the assumption of independence among channels in properly designed systems is verified reasonably well. Indeed, in our experiments, measured link quality indices did not differ more than 10% from what we expected from theory. This grants for redundant solutions tangible advantages over conventional Wi-Fi networks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	30

135	Characterizing Multihop Aerial Networks of COTS Multirotors	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) recently enabled a myriad of new applications spanning domains from personal entertainment to surveillance and monitoring. In this paper, we focus on using several small UAVs collaboratively to provide extended reach to an online video monitoring system for inspection of industrial installations. We make use of 802.11 radios on low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf UAVs, set up a time-division multiple access overlay protocol to avoid mutual interference, and enable high channel utilization in multihop networks. In particular, we provide a model for the quality of the UAV-to-UAV link, in terms of packet delivery ratio as a function of distance, packet size, and orientation, based on an extensive measurement campaign. We show that this platform is not omnidirectional in the horizontal plane and that UAV-to-UAV communication ceases around 75 m. Concerning the operation in a multihop mode to allow extending the network, the paper derives the optimal number of hops that maximize the end-to-end throughput, as well as the corresponding hop lengths. We validate our mathematical model with extensive experimental measurements transmitting payloads up to 200 m (over 802.11 g at 54 MBps). © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

137	Optimizing Time-of-Arrival Localization Solutions for Challenging Industrial Environments	Since Global Positioning System technologies cannot be used indoors, a significant amount of research focuses on developing radio-frequency-based alternatives for indoor localization. Unfortunately, most of the suggested solutions for indoor localization consist of theoretical work or have been evaluated in non-industrial environments, typically office spaces. To evaluate the influence of industrial environments on localization accuracy, in this paper, a time-of-arrival (ToA) approach was used to determine the stationary locations of a robot inside the w-iLab.t II testbed, an open industrial-like environment containing several metal obstacles. The ToA method utilizes the measured propagation time of a radio wave between a sender and receiver to estimate their corresponding distance. This paper evaluates several industrial-related deployment aspects that influence location accuracy and describes how their negative impact can be reduced, resulting in an almost 50% accuracy improvement in industrial environments. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	33
138	Dynamic Secrets and Secret Keys Based Scheme for Securing Last Mile Smart Grid Wireless Communication	An integrated and optimized smart grid cannot be achieved without a secure communication network. Due to the large-scale nature of the power system, the variety of technologies used, and limitations of communication bandwidth, supervisory applications for smart grid still use weak security in many deployments. Adversaries can potentially modify measurement values or inject bad commands over the network. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme based on dynamic secrets and encryption with secret keys. The scheme generates a series of dynamic secrets over the communication network, which are used to generate secret keys for data encryption. The generation of dynamic secret is frequent and no adversary can compromise the network for a longer period, even if he/she knows a secret key. The scheme is secure against eavesdropping, malicious communication injection, man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, impersonation attacks, and chosen-plaintext attacks. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that our scheme is feasible to be used in the communications between supervisory and control nodes of various smart grid applications. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24
139	Detection of Bearing Faults in Mechanical Systems Using Stator Current Monitoring	Induction motors have been responsible for running mechanical systems in the industry for many decades. Their diagnosis still remains a hot quest for the researchers using various techniques. In this study, motor current signature analysis (MCSA) technique has been used to detect the faulty bearing installed in load machine (coupled to an induction motor). It has been seen that faulty bearings installed in load machines do not directly alter airgap eccentricity of an induction motor. In fact, these bearing faults affect the resultant torque of an induction motor. As modulating fault components show very low amplitude, these are usually masked by noise. This paper is devoted towards extracting features of faulty components efficiently from stator current using continuous wavelet transform. This methodology is assessed for detecting outer race faults in bearings installed in load machines using MCSA. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	97
140	Dislocated Time Series Convolutional Neural Architecture: An Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Approach for Electric Machine	In most current intelligent diagnosis methods, fault classifiers of electric machine are built based on complex handcrafted features extractor from raw signals, which depend on prior knowledge and is difficult to implement intelligentization authentically. In addition, the increasingly complicated industrial structures and data make handcrafted features extractors less suited. Convolutional neural network (CNN) provides an efficient method to act on raw signals directly by weight sharing and local connections without feature extractors. However, effective as CNN works on image recognition, it does not work well in industrial applications due to the differences between image and industrial signals. Inspired by the idea of CNN, we develop a novel diagnosis framework based on the characteristics of industrial vibration signals, which is called dislocated time series CNN (DTS-CNN). The DTS-CNN architecture is composed of dislocate layer, convolutional layer, sub-sampling layer and fully connected layer. By adding a dislocate layer, this model can extract the relationship between signals with different intervals in periodic mechanical signals, thereby overcome the weaknesses of traditional CNNs and is more applicable for modern electric machines, especially under nonstationary conditions. Experiments under constant and nonstationary conditions are performed on a machine fault simulator to validate the proposed framework. The results and comparison with respect to the state of the art in the field is illustrated in detail, which highlights the superiority of the proposed method in industrial applications. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	240
141	Particle-Filter-Based Magnet Flux Linkage Estimation for PMSM Magnet Condition Monitoring Using Harmonics in Machine Speed	For permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), accurate magnet flux linkage information is critical for permanent magnet condition monitoring and drive performance improvement. This paper proposes a novel particle-filter-based magnet flux linkage estimation approach by using the harmonics in the machine speed. In the proposed approach, the harmonic current is first injected to change the speed harmonics, and the particle filter is then applied to estimate the magnet flux linkage from the speed harmonics. With a proper selection of injected harmonic current, it is capable of simultaneously estimating the magnet flux linkage and reducing the torque ripples as well as the speed ripples. The proposed approach is based on the machine mechanical equation, so it is not influenced by the magnetic saturation, the resistance variation, and the inverter nonlinearity. Specifically, at first, a novel state-space model is developed based on the machine mechanical equation, which models the relation between the magnet flux linkage and the speed harmonic. The state-space model is nonlinear, so the particle filter is employed for a magnet flux linkage estimation. Our particle-filter-based estimation approach is validated on a laboratory PMSM drive system under different loads, speeds, and temperatures. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
142	Remaining Useful Lifetime Estimation for Power MOSFETs under Thermal Stress with RANSAC Outlier Removal	Reliability of power converters is crucial for mission critical systems. Among the components that are susceptible to failure, power semiconductor devices are one of the major causes of the power converter failures. This paper focuses on the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation of degraded power MOSFETs, which are stressed by thermal cycling. The relative change in on-state resistance is identified as the fault signature. A data-driven RUL estimation algorithm based on a linear approximation model is proposed. The empirical coefficients are estimated by the classical least squares, where the outliers are removed by random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. A sliding window approach is used to track the nonlinearities. The window size, threshold value, and number of samples used by RANSAC are optimized with the genetic algorithm. The accuracy of the proposed RUL estimation tool is verified on a number of thermally aged discrete power MOSFET data. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42
143	Performance Evaluations and Measurements of the REALFLOW Routing Protocol in Wireless Industrial Networks	Industrial wireless sensor and actuator networks (IWSANs) offer significant advantages to industrial automation. However, high-reliability demands and hard communication deadlines pose challenges to its practical applications. To achieve this goal, flooding is considered as a promising approach due to multipath diversity and simplicity. In this paper, an enhanced version of REALFLOW, a flooding-based routing protocol for IWSANs is presented. Compared to the original REALFLOW, network management and network stability are improved. REALFLOW is compared with four other flooding protocols via simulations. The simulation results show that REALFLOW has better performance in terms of reliability and consecutive transmission errors when considering deadlines. Compared with normal flooding, REALFLOW achieves comparable reliability performance with decreased redundancy. Measurements from a prototype implementation conducted in an industrial manufacturing workshop reveal that high-reliability and low-application failure rates can be achieved, giving more confidence in providing reliable wireless sensing and actuating for industrial automation. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23
144	Distributed Unbiased FIR Filtering with Average Consensus on Measurements for WSNs	Industrial wireless sensor networks (WSNs) often operate under harsh conditions that require robustness from an estimator of a measured quantity.

The micro-UFIR filter is derived based on average consensus on measurements and, unlike the micro-KF, requires only one consensus filter. Better robustness of the micro-UFIR filter is shown analytically and confirmed by simulations of a WSN and a vehicle travelling along a circular trajectory under unpredictable impacts, impulsive noise, and errors in the noise statistics. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	31
145	Delay-Minimized Routing in Mobile Cognitive Networks for Time-Critical Applications	Cognitive radio significantly mitigates the spectrum scarcity for various applications built on wireless communication. Current techniques on mobile cognitive ad hoc networks (MCADNs), however, cannot be directly applied to time-critical applications due to channel interference, node mobility as well as unexpected primary user activities. In multichannel multiflow MCADNs, it becomes even worse because multiple links potentially interfere with each other. In this paper, we propose a delay-minimized routing (DMR) protocol for multichannel multiflow MCADNs. First, we formulate the DMR problem with the objective of delay minimization. Next, we propose a delay prediction model based on a conflict probability. Finally, we design the minimized path delay as a routing metric, and propose a heuristic joint routing and channel assignment algorithm to solve the DMR problem. Our DMR can find out the path with a minimal end-to-end (e2e) delay for time-critical data transmission. NS2-based simulation results demonstrate that our DMR protocol significantly outperforms related proposals in terms of average e2e delay, throughput, and packet loss rate. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	31
146	Efficient 5G Small Cell Planning with eMBMS for Optimal Demand Response in Smart Grids	Smart Grids (SGs) are emerging cyber-physical systems, equipped with sophisticated communication and information technologies, for efficient and large-scale power supply and management. SGs demand advanced communication technologies between energy providers and consumers, for enabling a control-feedback loop, by using time-dependent pricing. In this paper, we propose an efficient planning of 5G small cells, with evolved multimedia broadcast and multicast communication, between aggregators (small cells) and SG consumers, for efficient demand-response (DR) programs. After pointing out that optimal multicast scheduling and radio resource management problem is NP-complete, we propose two different solutions, based on dynamic programming (DP) and greedy heuristics, for minimizing the energy cost for DR customers. We also analyze the performance of SG user capacity for 5G single cell multicast and multicast broadcast single frequency network. Extensive OPNET simulation results, over actual energy data and real wireless trace, demonstrate that our proposed 5G small cell planning and multicast solutions are capable of reducing energy production cost by 30%, with up to 35% shift in peak energy load, low latency and packet drop. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	47
147	Fault Diagnosis for a Wind Turbine Generator Bearing via Sparse Representation and Shift-Invariant K-SVD	It is always a primary challenge in fault diagnosis of a wind turbine generator to extract fault character information under strong noise and nonstationary condition. As a novel signal processing method, sparse representation shows excellent performance in time-frequency analysis and feature extraction. However, its result is directly influenced by dictionary, whose atoms should be as similar with signal's inner structure as possible. Due to the variability of operation environment and physical structure in industrial systems, the patterns of impulse signals are changing over time, which makes creating a proper dictionary even harder. To solve the problem, a novel data-driven fault diagnosis method based on sparse representation and shift-invariant dictionary learning is proposed. The impulse signals at different locations with the same characteristic can be represented by only one atom through shift operation. Then, the shift-invariant dictionary is generated by taking all the possible shifts of a few short atoms and, consequently, is more applicable to represent long signals that in the same pattern appear periodically. Based on the learnt shift-invariant dictionary, the coefficients obtained can be sparser, with the extracted impulse signal being closer to the real signal. Finally, the time-frequency representation of the impulse component is obtained with consideration of both the Wigner-Ville distribution of every atom and the corresponding sparse coefficient. The excellent performance of different fault diagnoses in a fault simulator and a wind turbine proves the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Meanwhile, the comparison with the state-of-the-art method is illustrated, which highlights the superiority of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	150
148	Statistic-Based Method to Monitor Belt Transmission Looseness Through Motor Phase Currents	Belt-pulley systems are widely used in the industry due to their high efficiency and their low cost. However, only few works exist about the monitoring of their degradation. This paper details the impact of belt looseness on electrical measurements under steady and transient state in order to identify spectral signatures. This analysis enlightens the advantage of the transient state to detect belt looseness because it exacerbates belt slip. An innovative methodology is then proposed based on the application of a square-wave speed reference in order to monitor belt looseness. A statistical-based indicator is defined from the phase currents in order to automatically detect drifting of the indicator. A normalization process is also applied to increase the detection robustness. The proposed indicator is evaluated on a 30-kW induction machine and a direct-current machine coupled with two trapezoidal belts for three speed and four load conditions. It reaches very good results with almost 90% correct detections for 1% false alarms. These results are way better than those obtained with a classic spectral analysis during the steady state. Moreover, results demonstrate that higher load conditions are more accurate for the monitoring of belt looseness. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
149	Application of a Recursive Phasor Estimation Method for Adaptive Fault Component Based Differential Protection of Power Transformers	An adaptive differential protection method is proposed for power transformers. First, the phasors of captured current signals are computed using an online recursive S-transform-based method of phasor estimation with low computational burden. Then, the fault components of currents are calculated as a measure of disturbance severity. The relay employs the fault components of the restraint and differential currents to adjust slopes and pickup settings of its dual-slope characteristic curve according to the disturbance, and discriminates external and internal faults. To avoid malfunctions caused by inrush currents, an average power based index is also proposed, which has high values during inrush currents while it is near zero for faulty cases. The proposed method is implemented using MATLAB and electromagnetic transients program (EMTP) software packages and its performance is compared with the multiregional and self-adaptive approaches. In addition, real-data records of two differential relays located in the South West Interconnected System in Western Australia have also been used to determine the accuracy of the proposed power transformer protection algorithm. Both the simulation and the real data test results show that the proposed method is more reliable and secure for faulty and nonfaulty cases in analogy to the other two protection approaches. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
150	The Use of Bearing Currents and Vibrations in Lifetime Estimation of Bearings	Electric discharge machining current causes a significant amount of damage to bearings, producing pits in the rotating elements of the bearing, and ultimately leading to bearing failure. Although this relationship is well known and studied, little work has been done to relate bearing current discharge events to bearing vibrations for bearing failure prognosis. This paper proposes both experimental and computational approaches for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation of bearings by taking advantage of the relationship between current discharge events and the vibration signal. A test bed, which induces accelerated aging via applied electrical stress, is introduced to better understand the relationship between bearing currents, vibrations, and failure. Over the course of the experiments, multiple sensor data are collected from start to failure in order to correlate current data as well as vibration data to bearing failure. Finally, a computational framework that determines critical events from the current discharge events and uses the timing of these events to estimate RUL from vibration data is proposed. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53
151	Expectation-Maximization Particle-Filter- and Kalman-Filter-Based Permanent Magnet Temperature Estimation for PMSM Condition Monitoring Using High-Frequency Signal Injection	In permanent magnet synchronous machine, high-frequency (HF) signal injection has been extensively investigated for permanent magnet temperature (PMT) estimation, in which PMT is estimated from the temperature-dependent HF resistance. Existing studies require prior knowledge on the HF resistance and neglect the fact that PMT is temporally correlated. This paper proposes a state-space model for PMT estimation, in which PMT is modeled with a piecewise linear equation to explore the temporal correlation. The state-space model is nonlinear due to unknown model parameters, which is required to be known in existing studies. This paper proposes to use expectation maximization particle filter (EM-PF) for simultaneous PMT and model parameter estimation. After EM-PF estimation, the state-space model becomes linear, so Kalman filter is employed for online PMT estimation. The proposed EM-PF along with a Kalman-filter-based approach can explore the temporal correlation among PMTs to improve the estimation performance, which can be hardly achieved in existing studies regarding PMT as a time-independent parameter. It should be noted that EM-PF is for initial PMT and model parameter estimation, while Kalman filter is for online PMT estimation ensuring computation efficiency and real-time capability. Our approach is validated with both numerical and experimental investigations. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	49
152	Convolutional Discriminative Feature Learning for Induction Motor Fault Diagnosis	A convolutional discriminative feature learning method is presented for induction motor fault diagnosis. The approach firstly utilizes back-propagation (BP)-based neural network to learn local filters capturing discriminative information. Then, a feed-forward convolutional pooling architecture is built to extract final features through these local filters. Due to the discriminative learning of BP-based neural network, the learned local filters can discover potential discriminative patterns. Also, the convolutional pooling architecture is able to derive invariant and robust features. Therefore, the proposed method can learn robust and discriminative representation from the raw sensory data of induction motors in an efficient and automatic way.

154	Optimal Sensor Configuration and Feature Selection for AHU Fault Detection and Diagnosis	Experiments show that operation efficiency and reliability of buildings can greatly benefit from rich and relevant datasets. More specifically, data can be analyzed to detect and diagnose system and component failures that undermine energy efficiency. Among the huge quantity of information, some features are more correlated with the failures than others. However, there has been little research to date focusing on determining the types of data that can optimally support fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). This paper presents a novel optimal feature selection method, named information greedy feature filter (IGFF), to select essential features that benefit building FDD. On one hand, the selection results can serve as reference for configuring sensors in the data collection stage, especially when the measurement resource is limited. On the other hand, with the most informative features selected by the IGFF, the performance of building FDD could be improved and theoretically justified. A case study on air-handling unit (AHU) is conducted based on the dataset of the ASHRAE Research Project 1312. Numerical results show that, compared with several baselines, the FDD performances of conventional classification methods are greatly enhanced by the IGFF. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24
155	Ultra High Performance Wireless Control for Critical Applications: Challenges and Directions	Industrial applications aimed at real-time control and monitoring of cyber-physical systems pose significant challenges to the underlying communication networks in terms of determinism, low latency, and high reliability.

156	A Cooperative Operation of Novel PV Inverter Control Scheme and Storage Energy Management System Based on ANFIS for Voltage Regulation of Grid-Tied PV System	In this paper, the voltage regulation problem in low-voltage power distribution networks integrated with increased amount of solar photovoltaics (PV) has been addressed. This paper proposes and evaluates the cooperative performance of a novel proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control scheme for PV interfacing inverter based on intelligent adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and an ANFIS-based supervisory storage energy management system (EMS) for regulating the voltage of three-phase grid-connected solar PV system under any nonlinear and fluctuating operating conditions. The proposed ANFIS-based PID control scheme (ANFISPID) dynamically controls the PV inverter to inject/ absorb appropriate reactive power to regulate the voltage at point of common coupling (PCC) and provides robust response at any system worst case scenarios and grid faults. And the proposed ANFIS-based supervisory EMS controls the charge/discharge of the energy storage system when there is voltage deviation to cooperate with ANFISPID in PCC voltage regulation. The proposed ANFISPID-based PV inverter control scheme and ANFIS-based supervisory EMS are developed and simulated in MATLAB/ Simulink environment and their dynamic cooperative performances are compared with cooperative performances of conventional PID-based PV inverter control scheme and state-based EMS. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	80
157	Real-Time Big Data Delivery in Wireless Networks: A Case Study on Video Delivery	The huge volume of contents generated from mobile ends has dramatically contributed to big data. Unfortunately, current packet scheduling policies in wireless networks for the underlying big data delivery greatly hinder the utilization of the contents. Specifically, the delivery of real-time big data requires running-time interactions with users, as well as variable bandwidth consumptions to maintain fine user experience. There is no previous work designed for this kind of traffic. To mitigate this gap, a thorough-designed scheduling policy to assign and organize detailed packet transmissions for real-time big data is desired. This paper takes video delivery as a case study, which dominates the current real-time traffic and can be easily extended to other scenarios. We propose a novel scheduling policy, which assigns a proper number of video requests to servers and allocates bandwidth to these requests in a relatively small time scale. It helps with serving more users without compromising user experience of the current ones. We also prove that the scheduling policy has a guaranteed performance on the total number of served requests. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that our scheduling policy outperforms other state-of-art methods significantly. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25
158	Detection of False-Data Injection Attacks in Cyber-Physical DC Microgrids	Power electronics-intensive dc microgrids use increasingly complex software-based controllers and communication networks. They are evolving into cyber-physical systems (CPS) with sophisticated interactions between physical and computational processes, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. This paper presents a framework to detect possible false-data injection attacks (FDIAs) in cyber-physical dc microgrids. The detection problem is formalized as identifying a change in sets of inferred candidate invariants. Invariants are microgrids properties that do not change over time. Both the physical plant and the software controller of CPS can be described as Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) diagrams. The dynamic analysis infers the candidate invariants over the input/output variables of SLSF components. The reachability analysis generates the sets of reachable states (reach sets) for the CPS modeled as hybrid automata. The candidate invariants that contain the reach sets are called the actual invariants. The candidate invariants are then compared with the actual invariants, and any mismatch indicates the presence of FDIA. To evaluate the proposed methodology, the hybrid automaton of a dc microgrid, with a distributed cooperative control scheme, is presented. The reachability analysis is performed to obtain the reach sets and, hence, the actual invariants. Moreover, a prototype tool, HYbrid iNvariant GEneratoR, is extended to instrument SLSF models, obtain candidate invariants, and identify FDIA. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	157
159	A Simple Harmonic Reduction Method in Multipulse Rectifier Using Passive Devices	This paper proposes a novel and passive harmonic reduction method at dc link of multipulse rectifier (MPR). The proposed method uses a single-phase diode-bridge rectifier to generate circulating current, which can shape the input line current of MPR. The input side of the single-phase diode-bridge rectifier is connected with the secondary winding of interphase reactor (IPR), and its output side is connected with load, which can recycle the harmonic energy and feed to load. The operation mode of the single-phase diode-bridge rectifier is analyzed, and the turn ratio of the IPR is designed optimally. Under ideal condition, the proposed MPR operates as a 24-pulse rectifier, and its total harmonic distortion (THD) of input line current is about 7.6%. Most of all, the proposed method is easy to be used in different 12-pulse rectifier topologies, and its conduction losses are far less than that of the conventional double-tapped IPR.

160	An Implementation of Hybrid Control Strategy for Distributed Generation System Interface Using Xilinx System Generator	This paper presents an analytical study and hardware-in-loop (HIL) cosimulation design of a grid-connected inverter system with a combinational robust observer-based modified repetitive current controller. In this study, main attention is paid to improve power quality and tracking performance of a distributed generation (DG) interfacing system under various perturbations. The inherent delay in convergence of conventional repetitive controller (RC) is reduced by introducing a low pass filter in delay line and this configuration is named as modified RC (MRC). By adding an observer with MRC, system states can be reconstructed, which improve the system dynamic response. Robust stability and convergence criterion are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality using combined Lyapunov function and singular value decomposition technique, which determine the suitable parameters of feedback control and state observer gains. By utilizing these gains, the switching signals are generated to operate the DG interfacing inverter effectively. The performance of proposed controller is compared with traditional proportional integral, proportional resonant, and MRC under both normal and fault conditions. Finally, HIL cosimulation is performed by realizing the power circuit in MATLAB/Simulink as a simulation model and a control structure using Xilinx system generator platform as burnt in hardware Virtex-6 field programmable gate array (FPGA) ML605 evaluation kit. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	41
161	Study of the Phase Shift Plus PWM Control Strategy Based on a Resonant Bridge Modular Switched-Capacitor Converter	Bridge modular switched-capacitor converter (BMSCC) has been reported with symmetric and modular structure, and featured less output voltage ripple, less components cost, and convenient voltage extension but weak output voltage regulation. This paper presents a phase shift plus pulse width modulation (PWM) control strategy for the novel resonant BMSCC. With this control method, output voltage regulation and the limitation of the loop peak current to a proper range are implemented. Also, output voltage ripple could be effectively controlled as well through the voltage ripple characteristics analysis in different cases. Detailed analyses of the relationships between the switching phases of MOSFETs and the output voltage, the switching-phases of MOSFETs and the loop peak current are performed. Meanwhile, through optimal switching sequence, the proposed control method ensures that almost all switching devices maintain zero current switching or zero voltage switching operation, which results in high system efficiency. Using simulation software of the saber and hardware platform, the soft switching, output voltage, and peak current characteristics are verified. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6

163	Unattended Object Identification for Intelligent Surveillance Systems Using Sequence of Dual Background Difference	Image-based surveillance systems are widely employed toward safety and security applications in many fields. Cameras, that are connected over an IP network for monitoring public areas, can produce large quantities of video footage. It is tedious for humans to simultaneously observe every type of event on several cameras. Thus, it is necessary to build a user-friendly intelligent system, enabling the analysis of video to detect suspicious events. One of the most important tasks of this system would be to identify unattended objects to prevent an unexpected accident such as the bombing of a public space. This paper presents a novel technique for such a task. The method is based on a sequence of dual background differences, which is obtained by computing the intensity difference between the current and reference background models within a time period. A clustering and an object detector are then integrated to identify the unattended objects. The effectiveness of the method was verified using public and our own databases. The results confirmed that the method is efficient to detect unattended objects and is suitable for implementation in video surveillance systems. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42
164	Robust Cooperative Sensing with ON/OFF Signaling over Imperfect Reporting Channels	In this paper, we propose an on/offreporting mechanism for cooperative sensing of cognitive radio so that reporting overhead from secondary sensing users to a fusion center can be significantly reduced. A key advantage of our scheme is robust and energy-efficient cooperative sensing over imperfect reporting channels. Furthermore, ON/OFF reporting enables graceful degradation when sensing nodes fail during operation. We focus on hard decision of cooperative sensing with many energy detectors based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion. Instead of using the conventional and rule, we propose an iNOR rule that can achieve O(1) reporting overhead in total, irrespective of the number of sensing nodes. The asymptotic overhead value is given by P(H1) log (1/Pd), where P(H1) is the probability of primary user's presence and Pd is the target detection probability. In addition, we show that the or rule also has its asymptotically negligible reporting overhead given by P(H1) log (1/1-Pd). Significant reduction in reporting overhead of ON/OFF reporting contributes to power saving, which in turn realizes robust reporting to fusion center by overcoming channel fading. Our simulation results show that with the proposed technique fusion center can make a reliable decision to avoid harmful interference to the primary user. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13

167	Forecasting Rare Faults of Critical Components in LED Epitaxy Plants Using a Hybrid Grey Forecasting and Harmony Search Approach	In the light emitting diode (LED) manufacturing industry, the most expensive and crucial facilities are manufacturing machines. Condition-based maintenance (CBM) for crucial components of a manufacturing machine aims to forecast in advance the precise time when some aging component will be broken and replace it in time, to avoid performing abnormally to manufacture defect products. This study focuses on the CBM for a crucial component called particle filter of a pneumatic conveyor machine in the LED epitaxy plant. Conventional forecasting methods were based on the theory of statistics, which requests a large number of data samples and assumes some probability distribution. With advance of machine technology, however, the data samples of broken particle filters to be collected are very few, such that those conventional methods cannot be applied. As a result, this study proposes a novel hybrid grey forecasting and harmony search approach, in which grey forecasting was shown to perform well for small data samples. In the proposed method, operating conditions of particle filters are monitored and collected by industrial sensors. Then, those data are preprocessed by data filtering and clustering. Finally, a hybrid grey forecasting and harmony search approach is used to fit the curve of the aging condition of a particle filter. Numerical analysis of a real example in an LED epitaxy plant shows that the proposed method performs better than conventional methods. © 2017 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
168	Multirate Signal Processing to Improve FFT-Based Analysis for Detecting Faults in Induction Motors	Fault detection in induction motors (IM) has been studied during the past decades due to the role that these electric machines play in industry. Regular monitoring is performed on IM to diagnose their operating condition using vibration and stator current analysis. The acquired signal is then processed to extract the characteristic parameters of the fault. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used for this task, but it has intrinsic limitations like sensitivity to low signal-to-noise ratio, overlapping of closely-located spectral components, nonstationary signals, and spectral leakage. These limitations have been studied to improve the spectrum estimation, but spectral leakage has not received enough attention, even when its effects can be significant. This paper introduces multirate signal processing techniques that improve the FFT-based methods by reducing spectral leakage with fractional resampling. The methodology is applied to experimental signals to show the improvement of the FFT-based methods for detecting faults in IM. © 2016 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	60

In this work, the θ-logarithmic barrier-based method is employed to reformulate the economic dispatch problem, and the consensus-based approach is considered for developing fully distributed technology-enabled algorithms. Specifically, a novel distributed algorithm utilizes the minimum connected dominating set (CDS), which efficiently allocates the task of balancing supply and demand for the entire power network at the beginning of economic dispatch. Further, an event-triggered communication-based method for the incremental cost of each generator is able to reach a consensus, coinciding with the global optimality of the objective function. In addition, a fast gradient-based distributed optimization method is also designed to accelerate the convergence rate of the event-triggered distributed optimization.

170	Intelligent Energy Efficient Localization Using Variable Range Beacons in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks	In many applications of industrial wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes need to determine their own geographic position coordinates so that the collected data can be ascribed to the location from where it were gathered. We propose a novel intelligent localization algorithm that uses variable range beacon signals generated by varying the transmission power of beacon nodes. The algorithm does not use any additional hardware resources for ranging and estimates position using only radio connectivity by passively listening to the beacon signals. The algorithm is distributed, so each sensor node determines its own position and communication overhead is avoided. As the beacon nodes do not always transmit at maximum power and no transmission power is used by unknown sensor nodes for localization, the proposed algorithm is energy efficient. It also provides control over localization granularity. Simulation results show that the algorithm provides good accuracy under varying radio conditions. © 2016 IEEE.	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	37
171	Wind Turbine Gearbox Failure Identification with Deep Neural Networks	The feasibility of monitoring the health of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes based on the lubricant pressure data in the supervisory control and data acquisition system is investigated in this paper. A deep neural network (DNN)-based framework is developed to monitor conditions of WT gearboxes and identify their impending failures. Six data-mining algorithms, the k-nearest neighbors, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, ridge regression (Ridge), support vector machines, shallow neural network, as well as DNN, are applied to model the lubricant pressure. A comparative analysis of developed data-driven models is conducted and the DNN model is the most accurate. To prevent the overfitting of the DNN model, a dropout algorithm is applied into the DNN training process. Computational results show that the prediction error will shift before the occurrences of gearbox failures. An exponentially weighted moving average control chart is deployed to derive criteria for detecting the shifts. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach is demonstrated by examining real cases from wind farms in China and benchmarked against the gearbox monitoring based on the oil temperature data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	220

Based on the relationship between market price and bid price, the proposed optimal bidding model of EVA aims to minimize the conditional expectation of electricity purchase cost in two markets considering price volatility. Moreover, the penalty cost of the deviation between the bidding quantities is included to avoid large power variation and arbitrage. The conditional expectation optimization model is formulated as an expectation minimization problem with the conditional value-at-risk constraints. Based on the price data in the PJM market, simulation results verify that our model is a decision-making tool in electricity markets, which can help market players comprehend the variants of bid price, expected cost and probability of successful bidding. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	72
173	Risk-Averse Energy Trading in Multienergy Microgrids: A Two-Stage Stochastic Game Approach	Multienergy microgrids are a promising solution to improve overall energy (electricity, cooling, heating, etc.) efficiency. In this paper, a new optimal energy trading strategy is developed considering the risk from uncertain energy supply and demand in a set of individual multienergy microgrids. According to the historical data about energy supply of each microgrid, an aggregator aims to maximize each microgrid's profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding for renewable energy resources trading based microgrids. A novel two-stage stochastic game model with Cournot Nash pricing mechanism and the conditional value-at-risk criterion is proposed to characterize the payoff function of each microgrid. The sample average approximation (SAA) technique is employed to approximate the stochastic Nash equilibrium of the game model. The existence of the SAA Nash equilibrium is investigated and the corresponding Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm is also realized in a distributed manner. The proposed method is validated by numerical simulations on real-world data collected in Australia, and the results show that the SAA Nash equilibrium based strategy can effectively reduce the risk of not meeting the demand and improve the economic benefits for each microgrid. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	90
174	Deep convolutional computation model for feature learning on big data in internet of things	Currently, a large number of industrial data, usually referred to big data, are collected from Internet of Things (IoT). Big data are typically heterogeneous, i.e., each object in big datasets is multimodal, posing a challenging issue on the convolutional neural network (CNN) that is one of the most representative deep learning models. In this paper, a deep convolutional computation model (DCCM) is proposed to learn hierarchical features of big data by using the tensor representation model to extend the CNN from the vector space to the tensor space. To make full use of the local features and topologies contained in the big data, a tensor convolution operation is defined to prevent overfitting and improve the training efficiency. Furthermore, a high-order backpropagation algorithm is proposed to train the parameters of the deep convolutional computational model in the high-order space. Finally, experiments on three datasets, i.e., CUAVE, SNAE2, and STL-10 are carried out to verify the performance of the DCCM. Experimental results show that the deep convolutional computation model can give higher classification accuracy than the deep computation model or the multimodal model for big data in IoT. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	154
175	Decentralized Cloud-SDN Architecture in Smart Grid: A Dynamic Pricing Model	Smart grids (SG) energy management system and electric vehicle (EV) have gained considerable reputation in recent years. This has been enabled by the high growth of EVs on roads; however, this may lead to a significant impact on the power grids. In order to keep EVs far from causing peaks in power demand and to manage building energy during the day, it is important to perform an intelligent scheduling for EVs charging and discharging service and buildings areas by including different metrics, such as real-time price and demand-supply curve. In this paper, we propose a real-time dynamic pricing model for EVs charging and discharging service and building energy management, in order to reduce the peak loads. Our proposed approach uses a decentralized cloud computing architecture based on software define networking (SDN) technology and network function virtualization (NFV). We aim to schedule user's requests in a real-time way and to supervise communications between microgrids controllers, SG and user entities (i.e., EVs, electric vehicles public supply stations, advance metering infrastructure, smart meters, etc.). We formulate the problem as a linear optimization problem for EV and a global optimization problem for all microgrids. We solve the problems by using different decentralized decision algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that proposes a pricing model based on decentralized Cloud-SDN architecture in order to solve all the aforementioned issues. The extensive simulations and comparisons with related works proved that our proposed pricing model optimizes the energy load during peak hours, maximizes EVs utility, and maintains the microgrid stability.

176	Hybrid Approach Based on GA and PSO for Parameter Estimation of a Full Power Quality Disturbance Parameterized Model	Power quality (PQ) and PQ disturbances (PQD) are relevant for the industry due to the implied costs in most industrial processes. Besides, it is necessary to maintain the quality standards of the electrical grid to avoid damages in the equipment that is connected to the grid. Due to the nature and characteristics of the PQD present in the voltage and current signals, several studies have focused on detecting and classifying particular disturbances, or simple combinations between two or three of them, without presenting a methodology that describes all of them automatically. Hence, this paper proposes a hybrid approach integrating genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) with other techniques that make use of their individual capabilities to automatically find a wide range of PQD present in a voltage or current signal, regardless of their nature. To achieve this hybrid approach parameterization, a full PQD model is adopted to automate the search of every one of their parameters. The proposed approach is validated through synthetic signals, real data from the IEEE data base, and through data readings from a real process. A comparison using other recent heuristic techniques is made to show the robustness of the proposed hybrid approach. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	33

In the physical layer, headway distance of vehicles is modeled as a Wiener process, and the connection probability of D2D-V2V links is estimated by employing the Kolmogorov equation. In the social layer, the social relationship tightness that represents content selection similarities is obtained by Bayesian nonparametric learning based on real-world social big data, which are collected from the largest Chinese microblogging service Sina Weibo and the largest Chinese video-sharing site Youku. Then, a price-rising-based iterative matching algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated joint peer discovery, power control, and channel selection problem under various quality-of-service requirements.

178	Optimal decision making for big data processing at edge-cloud environment: An SDN perspective	With the evolution of Internet and extensive usage of smart devices for computing and storage, cloud computing has become popular. It provides seamless services such as e-commerce, e-health, e-banking, etc., to the end users. These services are hosted onmassive geodistributed data centers (DCs), which may be managed by different service providers. For faster response time, such a data explosion creates the need to expand DCs. So, to ease the load on DCs, some of the applications may be executed on the edge devices near to the proximity of the end users. However, such a multiedge-cloud environment involves huge data migrations across the underlying network infrastructure, which may generate long migration delay and cost. Hence, in this paper, an efficient workload slicing scheme is proposed for handling data-intensive applications inmultiedgecloud environment using software-defined networks (SDN). To handle the inter-DC migrations efficiently, an SDN-based control scheme is presented, which provides energy-Aware network traffic flow scheduling. Finally, a multileader multifollower Stackelberg game is proposed to provide costeffective inter-DC migrations. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is evaluated on Google workload traces using various parameters. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	97
179	Characterization of substation process bus network delays	This paper presents the characterization of network delays in an IEC61850 process bus substation area network, both through theoretical analysis and simulations. Several design targets were defined considering the recommendations of standards and good design practices: number of network hops, total network delay, probability of the delay being exceeded, link load, network topology and availability. An analytical delay estimation methodology is proposed, considering both the steady-state traffic and traffic resulting from a breaker failure event. A complete substation is taken as an example for characterizing the network delays, considering a star network topology. Simulations allow to obtain the cumulative distribution functions and percentile values of network delays. Results show a good agreement between the simulation and the analytical analysis. While the delay is best characterized statistically through simulation, finding the maximum network delay through simulations can be very time consuming, making the analytical analysis more suitable. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18

Given the complexity of information to analyze, existing tools often make use of visualization strategies to represent data aggregated throughout separate sessions and multiple users. In particular, heat maps are often adopted to study the distribution of mouse activity and identify page regions that are more frequently reached during interaction. Unfortunately, since Web contents are accessed via ever more heterogeneous devices, region-based heat maps cannot be exploited anymore to aggregate data concerning user's attention, since the same Web content may move to another page location or exhibit a different aspect depending on the access device used or the user agent setup. This paper presents the design of a visual analytics framework capable to deal with the above limitation by adopting a data collection approach that combines information about regions displayed with information about page structure. This way, the well-known heat map-based visualization can be produced, where interactions can be aggregated on a per-element basis independently of the specific access configuration. Experimental results showed that the framework succeeds in accurately quantifying user's attention and replicating results obtained by manual processing. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
184	Fog computing based face identification and resolution scheme in internet of things	The identification and resolution technology are the prerequisite for realizing identity consistency of physical-cyber space mapping in the Internet of Things (IoT). Face, as a distinctive noncoded and unstructured identifier, has especial advantages in identification applications. With the increase of face identification based applications, the requirements for computation, communication, and storage capability are becoming higher and higher. To solve this problem, we propose a fog computing based face identification and resolution scheme. Face identifier is first generated by the identification system model to identify an individual. Then, a fog computing based resolution framework is proposed to efficiently resolve the individual's identity. Some computing overhead is offloaded from a cloud to network edge devices in order to improve processing efficiency and reduce network transmission. Finally, a prototype system based on local binary patterns (LBP) identifier is implemented to evaluate the scheme. Experimental results show that this scheme can effectively save bandwidth and improve efficiency of face identification and resolution. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	159
185	Research on Traffic Flow Prediction in the Big Data Environment Based on the Improved RBF Neural Network	This paper proposes an optimized prediction algorithm of radial basis function neural network based on an improved artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm in the big data environment. The algorithm first uses crossover and mutation operators of the differential evolution algorithm to replace the search strategy of employed bees in the ABC algorithm, then improves the search strategy of onlookers in the ABC algorithm to produce an optimal candidate food source near the population. The algorithm can better balance local and global searching capability. To verify the efficiency of this algorithm in the big data environment, apply it to Lozi and Tent chaotic time series and measured traffic flow time series, and then compare it with K-nearest neighbor model, radial basis function (RBF) neural network model, improved back propagation neural network model, and RBF neural network based on a cloud genetic algorithm model. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of prediction for Lozi and Tent chaotic time series and the measured traffic flow improves greatly in the big data environment using the proposed algorithm, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in predicting traffic flow time series. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	154
186	A Distributed Parallel Cooperative Coevolutionary Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm for Large-Scale Optimization	A considerable amount of research has been devoted to multiobjective optimization problems. However, few studies have aimed at multiobjective large-scale optimization problems (MOLSOPs). To address MOLSOPs, which may involve big data, this paper proposes a message passing interface MPI-based distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (DPCCMOEA). DPCCMOEA tackles MOLSOPs based on decomposition. First, based on a modified variable analysis method, we separate decision variables into several groups, each of which is optimized by a subpopulation (species). Then, the individuals in each subpopulation are further separated to several sets. DPCCMOEA is implemented with MPI distributed parallelism and a two-layer parallel structure is constructed. We examine the proposed algorithm using the multiobjective test suites Deb-Thiele-Laumanns-Zitzler and Walking-Fish-Group. In comparison with cooperative coevolutionary generalized differential evolution 3 and multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decision variable analyses, which are state-of-the-art cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, experimental results show that the novel algorithm has better performance in both optimization results and time consumption. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	54
187	A Novel Embedding Method for Information Diffusion Prediction in Social Network Big Data	With the increase of social networking websites and the interaction frequency among users, the prediction of information diffusion is required to support effective generalization and efficient inference in the context of social big data era. However, the existing models either rely on expensive probabilistic modeling of information diffusion based on partially known network structures, or discover the implicit structures of diffusion from users' behaviors without considering the impacts of different diffused contents. To address the issues, in this paper, we propose a novel information-dependent embedding-based diffusion prediction (IEDP) model to map the users in observed diffusion process into a latent embedding space, then the temporal order of users with the timestamps in the cascade can be preserved by the embedding distance of users. Our proposed model further learns the propagation probability of information in the cascade as a function of the relative positions of information-specific user embeddings in the information-dependent subspace. Then, the problem of temporal propagation prediction can be converted into the task of spatial probability learning in the embedding space. Moreover, we present an efficient margin-based optimization algorithm with a fast computation to make the inference of the information diffusion in the latent embedding space. When applying our proposed method to several social network datasets, the experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach for the information diffusion prediction and the efficiency with respect to the inference speed compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	43
188	A Hierarchical Data Transmission Framework for Industrial Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks	A smart factory generates vast amounts of data that require transmission via large-scale wireless networks. Thus, the reliability and real-time performance of large-scale wireless networks are essential for industrial production. A distributed data transmission scheme is suitable for large-scale networks, but is incapable of optimizing performance. By contrast, a centralized scheme relies on knowledge of global information and is hindered by scalability issues. To overcome these limitations, a hybrid scheme is needed. We propose a hierarchical data transmission framework that integrates the advantages of these schemes and makes a tradeoff among real-time performance, reliability, and scalability. The top level performs coarse-grained management to improve scalability and reliability by coordinating communication resources among subnetworks. The bottom level performs fine-grained management in each subnetwork, for which we propose an intrasubnetwork centralized scheduling algorithm to schedule periodic and aperiodic flows. We conduct both extensive simulations and realistic testbed experiments. The results indicate that our method has better schedulability and reduces packet loss by up to 22% relative to existing methods. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	32
189	Mutual privacy preserving $k$-means clustering in social participatory sensing	In this paper, we consider the problem of mutual privacy protection in social participatory sensing in which individuals contribute their private information to build a (virtual) community. Particularly, we propose a mutual privacy preserving $k$-means clustering scheme that neither discloses an individual's private information nor leaks the community's characteristic data (clusters). Our scheme contains two privacy-preserving algorithms called at each iteration of the $k$-means clustering. The first one is employed by each participant to find the nearest cluster while the cluster centers are kept secret to the participants; and the second one computes the cluster centers without leaking any cluster center information to the participants while preventing each participant from figuring out other members in the same cluster. An extensive performance analysis is carried out to show that our approach is effective for $k$-means clustering, can resist collusion attacks, and can provide mutual privacy protection even when the data analyst colludes with all except one participant. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	86
190	Big Data Analytics for System Stability Evaluation Strategy in the Energy Internet	With the significant improvements in the Energy Internet, we have witnessed the explosion of multisource energy big data, whose characteristics of vast volume, fast velocity, and diverse variety not only formulate an essential infrastructure of the Energy Internet, but also bring threats to the system's stability. In this paper, we concern with the system-level stability issues in the Energy Internet and study how to maintain a stable and healthy energy network environment. To this end, we propose a system-level stability evaluation model in the Energy Internet based on a critical energy function to explore small disturbance stability region (SDSR), where SDSR can be acquired via estimating the operational data threshold of distributed generations. The threshold is estimated based on energy consumption rather than equilibrium nodes, which applies the energy function theory and reduces the computation complexity. Moreover, in our proposed model, we add the big data approximate analytics algorithm into hyperplane fitting to optimize and analyze the SDSR. Simulation results on SDSR in a single dominant oscillation mode and multiple dominant oscillation mode have demonstrated the advantages and superiority of our proposed method over the prior schemes. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	118
191	SafeDrive: Online Driving Anomaly Detection From Large-Scale Vehicle Data	Identifying driving anomalies is of great significance for improving driving safety. The development of the Internet-of-Vehicle (IoV) technology has made it feasible to acquire big data from multiple vehicle sensors, and such big data play a fundamental role in identifying driving anomalies. Existing approaches are mainly based on either rules or supervised learning. However, such approaches often require labeled data, which are typically not available in big data scenarios. In addition, because driving behaviors differ under vehicle statuses (e.g., speed and gear position), to precisely model driving behaviors needs to fuse multiple sources of sensor data. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose SafeDrive, an online and status-aware approach, which does not require labeled data. From a historical dataset, SafeDrive statistically offline derives a state graph (SG) as a behavior model. Then, SafeDrive splits the online data stream into segments and compares each segment with the SG. SafeDrive identifies a segment that significantly deviates from the SG as an anomaly. We evaluate SafeDrive on a cloud-based IoV platform with over 29 000 real connected vehicles. The evaluation results demonstrate that SafeDrive is capable of identifying a variety of driving anomalies effectively from a large-scale vehicle data stream with an overall accuracy of 93%; such identified driving anomalies can be used to timely alert drivers to correct their driving behaviors. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	68
192	A Manufacturing Big Data Solution for Active Preventive Maintenance	Industry 4.0 has become more popular due to recent developments in cyber-physical systems, big data, cloud computing, and industrial wireless networks. Intelligent manufacturing has produced a revolutionary change, and evolving applications, such as product lifecycle management, are becoming a reality. In this paper, we propose and implement a manufacturing big data solution for active preventive maintenance in manufacturing environments. First, we provide the system architecture that is used for active preventive maintenance. Then, we analyze the method used for collection of manufacturing big data according to the data characteristics. Subsequently, we perform data processing in the cloud, including the cloud layer architecture, the real-time active maintenance mechanism, and the offline prediction and analysis method. Finally, we analyze a prototype platform and implement experiments to compare the traditionally used method with the proposed active preventive maintenance method. The manufacturing big data method used for active preventive maintenance has the potential to accelerate implementation of Industry 4.0. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	278
193	Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Nondominated Sorting and Bidirectional Local Search for Big Data	The improved differential evolutionary algorithm (EA) discussed in this paper is used to solve high-dimensional big data. Specifically, the algorithm improves population diversity by expanding the searching scope of the population, prevents premature deaths of the population through wider and more specific searches, and aims to solve the high-dimensional issue. To achieve this improvement goal, the paper suggests a multilayer hierarchical architecture on the basis of the above-mentioned heuristic mechanism. In each layer of the hierarchical architecture in the dynamic subpopulation, individuals who are more suitable for isolated evolution can better coexist with the original main population. We propose a new multiobjective optimization algorithm based on nondominated sorting and bidirectional local search (NSBLS). The algorithm takes the local beam search as the main body. NSBLS outputs the nondominated solution set through a continuous iterative search when the iteration termination condition is satisfied. It is worthy to note that the iteration of NSBLS is similar to the generation of the EA; therefore, this paper uses generation to represent the iterations. An algorithm introduces a new distribution maintaining strategy based on the sampling theory to combine with the fast nondominated sorting algorithm in order to select a new population into the next iteration. NSBLS will compare with three classical algorithms: NSGA-II, MOEA/D-DE, and MODEA through a series of bi-objective test problems. The proposed nondominated sorting and local search is able to find a better spread of solutions and better convergence to the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the other four algorithms. The outstanding performance of the proposed technology was proven in well-known benchmark problems. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
194	Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of the High-Speed Train With Big Data Based on Deep Neural Networks	Bogies are an important component of high-speed trains. The level of mechanical performance of bogies has a major influence on the safety and reliability of high-speed train. Therefore, conducting fault diagnoses on bogies with big data is very important. Fault mechanisms of bogies are very complex, and feature signals are nonobvious. For these reasons, fault information of bogies cannot be effectively extracted using the traditional signal processing method. Therefore, this paper adopted the deep neural network to recognize faults in bogies. The deep neural network offers numerous benefits in this context. Using deep neural networks, fault information in a signal spectrum can be extracted in a selfadaptive method. This technique is free of dependence on extensive signal processing knowledge and diagnostic experience. Compared with the traditional intelligent diagnosis method, the deep neural network can obtain a higher diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, the deep neural network does not depend on the sample size, and it can obtain high diagnostic accuracy even when the sample size is relatively small. It also achieves very high diagnostic accuracy applied to high-speed trains with different speeds and different faults, which shows that the method is extensively applicable. Furthermore, the recognition accuracy rate of the deep neural network under normal conditions can reach 100%. This method provides a new paradigm for fault diagnosis of the high-speed train with big data and plays an important role in this field. © 2017 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	154
195	Public Interest Analysis Based on Implicit Feedback of IPTV Users	Modern information systems make it increasingly easy to gain more insight into the public interest, which is becoming more and more important in diverse public and corporate activities and processes. The disadvantage of existing research that focuses on mining the information from social networks and online communities is that it does not uniformly represent all population groups and that the content can be subjected to self-censoring or curation. In this paper, we propose and describe a framework and a method for estimating public interest from the implicit negative feedback collected from the Internet protocol television (IPTV) audience. Our research focuses primarily on the channel change events and their match with the content information obtained from closed captions. The presented framework is based on concept modeling, viewership profiling, and combines the implicit viewer reactions (channel changes) into an interest score. The proposed framework addresses both above-mentioned disadvantages or concerns. It is able to cover a much broader population, and it can detect even minor variations in user behavior. We demonstrate our approach on a large pseudonymized real-world IPTV dataset provided by an ISP, and show how the results correlate with different trending topics and with parallel classical long-term population surveys. &copy; 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
196	Hierarchy-cutting model based association semantic for analyzing domain topic on the web	Association link network (ALN) can organize massive Web information to provide many intelligent services in our big data society. Effective semantic layered technologies not only can provide theoretical support for knowledge discovery in Web resources, but also can improve the searching efficiency of related information systems such as Web information system and industrial information system. How to realize the layer division of association semantic by the hierarchy analysis of ALN is an important research topic. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchy-cutting model of association semantic. First, experiments of four types of keywords with different linking roles are conducted to discover the possible distribution law. Experimental results show that these keywords with association role reveal previous power-law distribution. Then, based on the discovered power-law distribution, up-cutting and down-cutting points are presented to divide the association semantic into three layers. At the same time, theories of the hierarchy-cutting model are presented. Finally, examples of current core topic and permanent topics belonging to a domain are given. The experiments show that hierarchy-cutting points have high accuracy. The multilayer theory of association semantic can provide a theoretical support for knowledge recommendation with different particle sizes on ALNs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
197	Data-centered runtime verification of wireless medical cyber-physical system	Wireless medical cyber-physical systems are widely adopted in the daily practices of medicine, where huge amounts of data are sampled by the wireless medical devices and sensors, and is passed to the decision support systems (DSSs). Many text-based guidelines have been encoded for work-flow simulation of DSS to automate health care based on those collected data. But for some complex and life-critical diseases, it is highly desirable to automatically rigorously verify some complex temporal properties encoded in those data, which brings new challenges to current simulation-based DSS with limited support of automatical formal verification and real-time data analysis. In this paper, we conduct the first study on applying runtime verification to cooperate with current DSS based on real-time data. Within the proposed technique, a user-friendly domain specific language, named DRTV, is designed to specify vital real-time data sampled by medical devices and temporal properties originated from clinical guidelines. Some interfaces are developed for data acquisition and communication. Then, for medical practice scenarios described in DRTV model, we will automatically generate event sequences and runtime property verifier automata. If a temporal property violates, real-time warnings will be produced by the formal verifier and passed to medical DSS. We have used DRTV to specify different kinds of medical care scenarios and have applied the proposed technique to assist existing wireless medical cyber-physical system. As presented in experiment results, in terms of warning detection, it outperforms the only use of DSS or human inspection, and improves the quality of clinical health care of hospital. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	78
198	Big data analytics for user-activity analysis and user-anomaly detection in mobile wireless network	The next generation wireless networks are expected to operate in fully automated fashion to meet the burgeoning capacity demand and to serve users with superior quality of experience. Mobile wireless networks can leverage spatio-temporal information about user and network condition to embed the system with end-to-end visibility and intelligence. Big data analytics has emerged as a promising approach to unearth meaningful insights and to build artificially intelligent models with assistance of machine learning tools. Utilizing aforementioned tools and techniques, this paper contributes in two ways. First, we utilize mobile network data (Big Data) - call detail record - to analyze anomalous behavior of mobile wireless network. For anomaly detection purposes, we use unsupervised clustering techniques namely k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. We compare the detected anomalies with ground truth information to verify their correctness. From the comparative analysis, we observe that when the network experiences abruptly high (unusual) traffic demand at any location and time, it identifies that as anomaly. This helps in identifying regions of interest in the network for special action such as resource allocation, fault avoidance solution, etc. Second, we train a neural-network-based prediction model with anomalous and anomaly-free data to highlight the effect of anomalies in data while training/building intelligent models. In this phase, we transform our anomalous data to anomaly-free and we observe that the error in prediction, while training the model with anomaly-free data has largely decreased as compared to the case when the model was trained with anomalous data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	130

However, threats arising from the adoption of information hiding techniques have been mainly neglected. In this perspective, the paper investigates how personal cloud storage services can be used for building covert channels for stealthy exchange of information through the Internet. To have a realistic use case, we consider the Dropbox application and we present the performance evaluation of two different covert communication methods.

200	Computation partitioning for mobile cloud computing in a big data environment	The growth of mobile cloud computing (MCC) is challenged by the need to adapt to the resources and environment that are available to mobile clients while addressing the dynamic changes in network bandwidth. Big data can be handled via MCC. In this paper, we propose a model of computation partitioning for stateful data in the dynamic environment that will improve the performance. First, we constructed a model of stateful data streaming and investigated the method of computation partitioning in a dynamic environment. We developed a definition of direction and calculation of the segmentation scheme, including single-frame data flow, task scheduling, and executing efficiency. We also defined the problem for a multiframe data flow calculation segmentation decision that is optimized for dynamic conditions and provided an analysis. Second, we proposed a computation partitioning method for single-frame data flow. We determined the data parameters of the application model, the computation partitioning scheme, and the task and work order data stream model. We followed the scheduling method to provide the optimal calculation for data frame execution time after computation partitioning and the best computation partitioning method. Third, we explored a calculation segmentation method for single-frame data flow based on multiframe data using multiframe data optimization adjustment and prediction of future changes in network bandwidth. We were able to demonstrate that the calculation method for multiframe data in a changing network bandwidth environment is more efficient than the calculation method with the limitation of calculations for single-frame data. Finally, our research verified the effectiveness of single-frame data in the application of the data stream and analyzed the performance of the method to optimize the adjustment of multiframe data. We used a MCC platform prototype system for face recognition to verify the effectiveness of the method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	54

However, because of the randomness of the vehicle movement and the complexity of a driving environment, attempts to develop an effective localization solution face certain difficulties. In this paper, an overlapping and hierarchical social clustering model (OHSC) is first designed to classify the vehicles into different social clusters by exploring the social relationship between them. By using the results of the OHSC model, we propose a social-based localization algorithm (SBL) that use location prediction to assist in global localization in the vehicular networks. The experiment results validate the performance of the OHSC model and show that the presented SBL algorithm demonstrates superior localization performance compared with the existing methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	55
202	Dynamic adaptive replacement policy in shared last-level cache of DRAM/PCM hybrid memory for big data storage	The increasing demand on the main memory capacity is one of the main big data challenges. Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) does not represent the best choice for a main memory, due to high power consumption and low density. However, the nonvolatile memory, such as the phase-change memory (PCM), represents an additional choice because of the low power consumption and high-density characteristic. Nevertheless, the high access latency and limited write endurance have disabled the PCM to replace the DRAM currently. Therefore, a hybrid memory, which combines both the DRAM and the PCM, has become a good alternative to the traditional DRAM memory. Both DRAM and PCM disadvantages are challenges for the hybrid memory. In this paper, a dynamic adaptive replacement policy (DARP) in the shared last-level cache for the DRAM/PCM hybrid main memory is proposed. The DARP distinguishes the cache data into the PCM data and the DRAM data, then, the algorithm adopts different replacement policies for each data type. Specifically, for the PCM data, the least recently used (LRU) replacement policy is adopted, and for the DRAM data, the DARP is employed according to the process behavior. Experimental results have shown that the DARP improved the memory access efficiency by 25.4%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	43
203	Grid Interfaced Distributed Generation System with Modified Current Control Loop Using Adaptive Synchronization Technique	This paper presents real-time implementation of a grid interfaced distributed generation (DG) system with modified current control loop using three phase amplitude adaptive notch filter (AANF) based synchronization tool. A grid current feedback based modified $dq$-current control technique for interfacing inverter is developed in order to achieve constant loading on the grid, transient-free operation, and power factor improvement close to unity power factor (UPF) of the utility grid during sudden load variations. This technique does not require separate calculation of reference reactive component and harmonics component of currents hence reduces control circuit complexity. In addition, it requires only three voltage and three current sensors. Three phase AANF is developed and is used for online extraction of utility voltage phase angle to generate synchronized reference current signals for interfacing inverter. AANF is used because of its adjustable accuracy and amplitude adaptability even under unbalanced voltage sag and swell, frequency variation, and distorted grid conditions. Fast and accurate behavior of three phase AANF improves the dynamic response of entire DG system control performance for sudden load variations. The dynamic behavior of the proposed grid interfaced DG system is experimentally evaluated in maintaining constant loading on grid, transient-free operation, and power factor improvement close to UPF operation of the utility grid, by compensating total reactive power and harmonic current demanded by variable linear as well as nonlinear load. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	46
204	Lightweight break-glass access control system for healthcare internet-of-things	Healthcare Internet-of-things (IoT) has been proposed as a promising means to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of patient care. Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and accessed by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while preventing unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper, we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system that supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	75
205	Leveraging analysis of user behavior to identify malicious activities in large-scale social networks	With the enormous growth and volume of online social networks and their features, along with the vast number of socially connected users, it has become difficult to explain the true semantic value of published content for the detection of user behaviors. Without understanding the contextual background, it is impractical to differentiate among various groups in terms of their relevance and mutual relations, or to identify the most significant representatives from the community at large. In this paper, we propose an integrated social media content analysis platform that leverages three levels of features, i.e., user-generated content, social graph connections, and user profile activities, to analyze and detect anomalous behaviors that deviate significantly from the norm in large-scale social networks. Several types of analyses have been conducted for a better understanding of the different user behaviors in the detection of highly adaptive malicious users. We attempted a novel approach regarding the process of data extraction and classification to contextualize large-scale networks in a proper manner. We also collected a significant number of user profiles from Twitter and YouTube, along with around 13 million channel activities. Extensive evaluations were conducted on real-world datasets of user activities for both social networks. The evaluation results show the effectiveness and utility of the proposed approach. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	38
206	Differential Evolution with a New Encoding Mechanism for Optimizing Wind Farm Layout	This paper presents a differential evolution algorithm with a new encoding mechanism for efficiently solving the optimal layout of the wind farm, with the aim of maximizing the power output. In the modeling of the wind farm, the wake effects among different wind turbines are considered and the Weibull distribution is employed to estimate the wind speed distribution. In the process of evolution, a new encoding mechanism for the locations of wind turbines is designed based on the characteristics of the wind farm layout. This encoding mechanism is the first attempt to treat the location of each wind turbine as an individual. As a result, the whole population represents a layout. Compared with the traditional encoding, the advantages of this encoding mechanism are twofold: 1) the dimension of the search space is reduced to two, and 2) a crucial parameter (i.e., the population size) is eliminated. In addition, differential evolution serves as the search engine and the caching technique is adopted to enhance the computational efficiency. The comparative analysis between the proposed method and seven other state-of-the-art methods is conducted based on two wind scenarios. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is able to obtain the best overall performance, in terms of the power output and execution time. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	70

We present two approaches that rely on a discretization of the state space, which differ in their interpretation of the discretized density. The first option is a piecewise constant density and the second option is a Dirac-mixture density. We show how circular filters can be derived and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. In addition, we show how to extend the Dirac-based approach to estimation on the special Euclidean group in 2D, the group of rigid body motions in the plane, using Rao-Blackwellization.

A motion planner is combined with a scheduler allowing each AGV to update its destination resource during navigation in order to complete the transported product. The proposed strategy is based on two steps. The first step consists in planning a presumed trajectory to avoid collision conflicts previously detected by a central supervisor, enabling more appropriate decentralized scheduling by AGVs. The presumed trajectories, which represent the intentions of AGVs, are then exchanged with neighboring AGVs. The second step uses the presumed trajectories of neighbors to compute a collision-free trajectory according to the priority policy.

210	Compressed acquisition and denoising recovery of EMGdi signal in WSNs and IoT	Telemonitoring of diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi) signal in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) holds the promise to be an evolving direction in personalized medicine. The WSNs and IoT enable EMGdi information telemonitoring and communications technologies play important roles in the process of personal medical care, especially for the respiratory diseases. However, while designing such a system, one should consider the required functionality, miniaturization, energy efficiency, etc., to make fewer resources required in WSNs and IoT. Conventional methods of data acquisition cannot energy-effectively compress data with reduced device costs. Different from the traditional compression methods, compressed sensing (CS) takes promising steps toward these challenges. Unfortunately, EMGdi is not sparse in time domain. Hence, current CS algorithms are extremely difficult to use directly for recovering EMGdi.

211	Intelligent Early Warning of Power System Dynamic Insecurity Risk: Toward Optimal Accuracy-Earliness Tradeoff	Dynamic insecurity risk of a power system has been increasingly concerned due to the integration of stochastic renewable power sources (such as wind and solar power) and complicated demand response. In this paper, an intelligent early-warning system to achieve reliable online detection of risky operating conditions is proposed. The proposed intelligent system (IS) consists of an ensemble learning model based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and a decision-making process under a multiobjective programming framework. Taking an ensemble form, the randomness existing in individual ELM training is generalized and reliable classification results can be obtained. The decision making is designed for ELM ensemble whose parameters are optimized to search for the optimal tradeoff between the warning accuracy and the warning earliness of the proposed IS. The compromise solution turns out to significantly speed up the overall computation with an acceptable sacrifice in the accuracy (e.g., from 100% to 99.9%). More importantly, the proposed IS can provide multiple and switchable performances to the operators in order to satisfy different local dynamic security assessment requirements. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	72
212	Robust Finite-Time Control for Autonomous Operation of an Inverter-Based Microgrid	Recently, more and more small-scale renewable generation sources based distributed generators are integrated to the existing power network through power electronic-based converters. Microgrid has been proposed as a solution to meet the challenges posed by highly intermittent renewable generations. To address the fast response and complex operating conditions of various inverters in an autonomous microgrid, this paper proposes a robust finite-time control algorithm for frequency/voltage regulation and active/reactive power control. The major advantages of the proposed control algorithm include, being robust and stable against various load disturbances, unmodeled dynamics and system parameter perturbations; enabling flexible convergence time according to user preferences and different operating conditions' requirements. The finite-time convergence of the robust control algorithm is guaranteed through rigorous analysis and the balance between control accuracy and chattering suppression is investigated. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust finite-time control algorithm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	38
213	Historical-Data-Based Energy Management in a Microgrid with a Hybrid Energy Storage System	In a microgrid, due to potential reverse power profiles between the renewable energy source (RES) and the loads, energy storage devices are employed to achieve high self-consumption of RES and to minimize power surplus flowing back into the main grid. This paper proposes a variable charging/discharging threshold method to manage the energy storage system. In addition, an adaptive intelligence technique (AIT) is put forward to raise the power management efficiency. A battery-ultra-capacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with merits of high energy and power density is used to evaluate the proposed method with on-site-measured RES output data. Compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on the precise predicted data of the load and the RES, the results show that the proposed method can achieve better load smoothing and self-consumption of the RES without the requirement of precise load and RES forecasting. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	48
214	Design and Implementation of Disturbance Compensation-Based Enhanced Robust Finite Control Set Predictive Torque Control for Induction Motor Systems	Finite-control-set-based predictive torque control (PTC) method has received more and more attention in recent years due to its fast torque response. However, it also has two drawbacks that could be improved. First, the torque reference in the cost function of the existing PTC method is generated by the proportional-integral speed controller, so torque reference's generation rate is not fast and its accuracy is low especially when the load torque is given suddenly and inertia value is varying. In addition, the variable prediction of the traditional PTC method depends on the system model, which also has the problem of parameter uncertainties. This paper investigates a disturbance observer (DOB)-based PTC approach for induction motor systems subject to load torque disturbances, parameter uncertainties, and time delays. Not only does the speed loop adopt a DOB-based feed-forward compensation method for improving the system disturbance rejection ability and robustness, but the flux, current, and torque predictions are also improved by using this technique. The simulation and experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	91
215	Modeling and Analysis of Lithium Battery Operations in Spot and Frequency Regulation Service Markets in Australia Electricity Market	Renewable share in the global total energy mix is predicted to grow, and this leads to an increase in the required capacity for frequency regulation. While an electric vehicle (EV) is gaining more popularity, a collection of retired EV battery packs provides an economic option for meeting the additional frequency regulation needs. In this paper, a battery market operation model is proposed to maximize financial return, and a battery operation cost estimator is built to evaluate the potential impacts of market operations on the battery lifespan. Specifically, the model is designed for retired EV lithium batteries under the Australian national electricity market framework. It predicts the automatic-generation-control energy due to the frequency regulation service offers. Battery cycle life cost and battery capacity degradation are considered in the model.

216	Imbalance Learning Machine-Based Power System Short-Term Voltage Stability Assessment	In terms of machine learning-based power system dynamic stability assessment, it is feasible to collect learning data from massive synchrophasor measurements in practice. However, the fact that instability events rarely occur would lead to a challenging class imbalance problem. Besides, short-term feature extraction from scarce instability seems extremely difficult for conventional learning machines. Faced with such a dilemma, this paper develops a systematic imbalance learning machine for online short-term voltage stability assessment. A powerful time series shapelet (discriminative subsequence) classification method is embedded into the machine for sequential transient feature mining. A forecasting-based nonlinear synthetic minority oversampling technique is proposed to mitigate the distortion of class distribution. Cost-sensitive learning is employed to intensify bias toward those scarce yet valuable unstable cases. Furthermore, an incremental learning strategy is put forward for online monitoring, contributing to adaptability and reliability enhancement along with time. Simulation results on the Nordic test system illustrate the high performance of the proposed learning machine and of the assessment scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	98
217	An Accurate and Fast Converging Short-Term Load Forecasting Model for Industrial Applications in a Smart Grid	Short-term load forecasting (STLF) models are very important for electric industry in the trade of energy. These models have many applications in the day-to-day operations of electric utilities such as energy generation planning, load switching, energy purchasing, infrastructure maintenance, and contract evaluation. A large variety of STLF models have been developed that trade off between forecast accuracy and convergence rate. This paper presents an accurate and fast converging STLF model for industrial applications in a smart grid. In order to improve the forecast accuracy, modifications are devised in two popular techniques: mutual information based feature selection; and enhanced differential evolution algorithm based error minimization. On the other hand, the convergence rate of the overall forecast strategy is enhanced by devising modifications in the heuristic algorithm and in the training process of the artificial neural network. Simulation results show that accuracy of the newly proposed forecast model is 99.5% with moderate execution time, i.e., we have decreased the average execution of the existing bilevel forecast strategy by 52.38%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	95
218	A DSE-Based Power System Frequency Restoration Strategy for PV-Integrated Power Systems Considering Solar Irradiance Variations	With power networks undergoing an unprecedented transition from traditional power systems to modern electric grids integrated with renewable energy sources, maintaining frequency stability of generators in modern power systems has become one of the major concerns. Targeting this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel frequency restoration strategy in photovoltaics (PV)-connected power systems using decentralized dynamic state estimation technique and PV power plant as a contingency power source. When a sudden increase in load demand occurs, the output power of PV panels is increased in order to compensate for the shortage of real power capacity of the generator, in order to restore the frequency of a certain generator bus bar. An unscented Kalman filter-based decentralized dynamic estimation is utilized in this study to estimate the frequency of a selected generator bus bar with local noisy voltage and current measurement data acquired by using phasor measurement units. Solar luminous intensity may vary over a period of time in different seasons, weather conditions, etc., which causes the variations in the output power of PV power plants. This irradiance uncertainty is also considered in this study. The proposed control strategy not only incorporates the frequency deviations of a generator bus-bar, but also takes into account the tie-line power deviations under disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate the capacity of proposed control schemes in restoring the frequency of generator bus-bars and also maintaining the tie-line power flowing between adjoining areas at it scheduled value. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	34
219	A Quasi-Resonant Switched-Capacitor Multilevel Inverter with Self-Voltage Balancing for Single-Phase High-Frequency AC Microgrids	In this paper, a quasi-resonant switched-capacitor (QRSC) multilevel inverter (MLI) is proposed with self-voltage balancing for single-phase high-frequency ac (HFAC) microgrids. It is composed of a QRSC circuit (QRSCC) in the frontend and an H-bridge circuit in the backend. The input voltage is divided averagely by the series-connected capacitors in QRSCC, and any voltage level can be obtained by increasing the capacitor number. The different operational mechanism and the resulting different application make up for the deficiency of the existing switched-capacitor topologies. The capacitors are connected in parallel partially or wholly when discharging to the load, thus the self-voltage balancing is realized without any high-frequency balancing algorithm. In other words, the proposed QRSC MLI is especially adapted for HFAC fields, where fundamental frequency modulation is preferred when considering the switching frequency and the resulting loss. The quasi-resonance technique is utilized to suppress the current spikes that emerge from the instantaneous parallel connection of the series-connected capacitors and the input source, decreasing the capacitance, increasing their lifetimes, and reducing the electromagnetic interference, simultaneously. The circuit analysis, power loss analysis, and comparisons with typical switched-capacitor topologies are presented. To evaluate the superior performances, a nine-level prototype is designed and implemented in both simulation and experiment, whose results confirm the feasibility of the proposed QRSC MLI. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	87
220	The Coordinated Development Path of Renewable Energy and National Economy in China Considering Risks of Electricity Market and Energy Policy	The long-standing over-reliance on fossil fuels brings urgent environmental issues. To reduce emissions and maintain a sustained economic growth, many countries seek for energy revolution. With the help of smart grid technology, renewable energy eventually plays an indispensable role in energy production and consumption. Electricity market mechanisms and energy policies are thus developed rapidly and can pose more risks to national economy.

221	Multiple Perspective-Cuts Outer Approximation Method for Risk-Averse Operational Planning of Regional Energy Service Providers	In the smart grid and future energy internet environment, a regional energy service provider (RESP) may be able to integrate multiple energy resources such as generator units, demand response, electrical vehicle charging/swapping stations, and carbon emission trading to participate in the market. By imploring a well-known portfolio optimization theory conditional value-at-risk to tackle electricity price uncertainty, this paper formulates the risk-averse day-ahead operational planning for such a RESP as a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP), named as RA-RESP. A global optimization method, named as multiple perspective-cuts outer approximation method (MPC-OAM) is proposed to solve this model efficiently. A remarkable stronger and tighter mixed integer linear programing master problem is designed to accelerate the convergence of the proposed method. Comprehensive simulation results show that, compared with existing day-ahead planning models, the RA-RESP is a good compromise between profit-based models and cost-based ones. The proposed MPC-OAM can solve complicated RA-RESP problem efficiently, and compared with state-of-the-art solution techniques, the MPC-OAM outperforms in both computing speed and solution quality, especially for scenario which includes more nonlinear factors. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	17

In addition, it utilizes a SPV feed-forward loop to improve the dynamic response and reduces the burden on the proportional-integral controller by regulating dc bus voltage. To control the switching sequences of VSC, a high precision quadrature control is used which extracts the fundamental current from the contaminated load current. The mathematical formulation of quadrature control is corroborated by the experimental results of SECS under different operating conditions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	31
223	Probabilistic Hosting Capacity for Active Distribution Networks	The increased connection of distributed generation (DG), such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT), has shifted the current distribution networks from being passive (consuming energy) into active (consuming/producing energy). However, there is still no consensus about how to determine the maximum amount of DGs that are allowed to be connected, i.e., how to quantify a so-called 'hosting capacity' (HC). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel risk assessment tool for estimating network HC by considering uncertainties associated with PV, WT, and loads. This evaluation is performed using the likelihood approximation approach. The paper, also, proposes a utilization of clearness index for localized solar irradiance prediction of PV. In addition, we propose the use of sparse grid technique as an effective means for uncertainty computation while the use of Monte Carlo technique is taken for a comparison purpose. Two actual distribution networks (11-buses and South Australian large feeder) are considered as case studies to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tool. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	63

Advances in smart grid technologies are enabling more data to be collected and analyzed in real-time for many kinds of smart grid applications. As the amount of data increases, the traditional smart grid data management system cannot provide sufficient storage and processing capacities. To address these challenges, cloud computing is being introduced into the power system and the cloud-based smart grid data management system has been proposed to better support smart grid applications. In this cloud-based system, the data are stored and analyzed by the remote cloud server according to the requirements of smart grid applications. However, the loss of physical control over the smart grid data makes it a significant challenge in ensuring the integrity of the data. Many provable data possession schemes have been proposed in the past few years. However, most of them suffer from serious security weaknesses or poor performance. We propose an efficient certificateless provable data possession (CL-PDP) scheme for cloud-based smart grid applications. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is provably secure in a robust security model and can satisfy several security requirements. Performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme results in lower computation costs as compared to two recently proposed CL-PDP schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	57

Based on the novel confident information coverage (CIC) model, this work focuses on how to heal the CIC holes in hybrid IWSNs containing both static nodes and mobile nodes. We pinpoint the CIC hole healing (CICHH) problem with the goal of selecting and dispatching some randomly scattered mobile nodes to the CIC holes detected by the stationary nodes such that the CIC holes can be repaired and the CIC performance can be satisfied, and prove its NP-completeness. For handling the CICHH problem, we devise two energy-efficient heuristic solutions including a centralized CICHH algorithm and a distributed one. Both the proposed schemes aim at efficiently healing the CIC holes while minimizing the total moving energy consumption of the dispatched mobile nodes, or maximizing the mobile nodes' average remaining energy after movement, or minimizing the maximum mobile energy consumption of each dispatched mobile node. Experimental simulation results show the proposed schemes can energy-efficiently heal the CIC holes and outperform three peer algorithms in terms of energy efficiency and coverage ratio. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53

235	Spare Parts List Recommendations for Multiple-Component Redundant Systems Using a Modified Pareto Ant Colony Optimization Approach	High availability requirements for systems have become common in many industry sectors. In order to comply with these requirements, companies must keep spare parts to reduce system downtime when a failure event occurs. A problem that comes up is the definition of the set of spare parts that should be acquired to ensure that the desired availability will be achieved. Efficient algorithms are available to solve this problem for the cases in which the failure of any component within the system leads to a system failure. However, highly integrated systems for safety-critical applications commonly have complex interactions among their components. Also, redundancies are commonly used in system architecture. For these systems, finding nondominated recommended spare parts lists (RSPLs) is a challenging task. The problem addressed in this paper consists in finding nondominated solutions for a bi-objective RSPL problem considering RSPL cost and system availability. We propose an algorithm to solve the RSPL problem using a modified Pareto ant colony optimization (MPACO) approach. In the proposed MPACO, we use marginal analysis to generate the initial population. Also, we propose a new approach to perform the pheromone update step based on the distances between consecutive points in the current solution. Numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the application of the proposed MPACO in three different multiple-component redundant systems with different complexity levels.

237	Certificateless public key authenticated encryption with keyword search for industrial internet of things	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) integrates various types of intelligent terminals, mobile devices, and communication technologies to enable the upgrade of traditional industries to intelligent industries. IIoT relies on the powerful data processing capabilities of cloud computing to reduce the cost of various on-demand services as per the requirements of users. However, the privacy and confidentiality of the outsourced data should be protected in this environment because the data are typically 'handled' by a third-party service provider. An encryption technique can guarantee the confidentiality of the data but it limits data retrieval due to its innate 'all-or-nothing' decryption feature. To apply encryption to privacy-preserving data retrieval, many public key encryption techniques with keyword search systems have been proposed in the literature. However, most of the existing schemes are vulnerable to inside keyword guessing attack (IKGA), which is caused by a small keyword space. To address this problem, we propose a certificateless public key authenticated encryption with keyword search scheme, which is provably secure against IKGA. A performance analysis of the proposed scheme demonstrates that it is more secure and effective compared with other certificateless public key encryption with keyword search schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	103

Thus, this work proposes a methodology for detecting anomalies by optimizing the data extraction and by classifying traffic-related features. In order to cope with this proposal, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based classifier is trained using selected relevant features. These features are extracted using variable sized sliding window and selected according to their correlation with the other features and the expected output of the classifier. The number of relevant features can vary according to performance indicators of the classifier. The proposed methodology was exploited for identifying four different events of PROFINET networks. The performance of the ANN-based classifier was considered successful for all cases.

241	Flexible Fuzzy PID Controller (FFPIDC) and a Nature-Inspired Method for Its Construction	In this paper, a new approach to fuzzy controller construction which combines features of proportional-integral-derivative controllers and flexible fuzzy systems is proposed. Flexibility of the fuzzy systems used makes it possible to interpret a control process and reduce the controller structure, which can make hardware implementation easier. The proposed approach uses knowledge about the controlled object and possibilities offered by nature-inspired hybrid population-based algorithms. These algorithms allow us to simultaneously select controller structure and parameters while taking into account a set of evaluation criteria. The criteria can include the quality of control, controller complexity, control process interpretability, etc. This is important in those applications where an atypical controller structure needs to be selected or an extended set of expectations has to be taken into account. This approach was tested using typical control problems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
242	Data Privacy-Preserving Automation Architecture for Industrial Data Exchange in Smart Cities	Information exchange across different entities, aiming at bridging various information 'islands' that enclose specific domain understandings, has become an important means to achieve advanced intelligence toward smart cities. However, the concern of data privacy hinders the progress to establish a highly cooperative information sharing ecosystem. Existing data sharing platforms work as separate systems without incorporating the data privacy processing feature. Data privacy processing often needs to be manually handled offline using detached toolkits or systems before publishing - lack of automation, which makes it difficult to meet the evergrowing data exchange demand in both volume and frequency. In this paper, driven by real-world needs, a novel backend computing architecture, named data privacy-preserving automation architecture (DPA), is proposed to facilitate online privacy-protection processing automation and secure data privacy, which is able to seamlessly integrate with companies' principal application system in an interruption-free manner, allowing for adaption to flexible models and quality of service (QoS) guarantee for cross-entity data exchange. A novel QoS management approach, based on actor mode concurrency, is proposed for privacy processing task prioritization in application layer. A prototype system has been implemented based on real-world mobility application to demonstrate the main features of the DPA architecture. The DPA architecture can be flexibly adapted for various domain applications of smart city development. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
243	A Multirobot Cooperation Framework for Sewing Personalized Stent Grafts	This paper presents a multirobot system for manufacturing personalized medical stent grafts. The proposed system adopts a modular design, which includes a (personalized) mandrel module, a bimanual sewing module, and a vision module. The mandrel module incorporates the personalized geometry of patients, while the bimanual sewing module adopts a learning-by-demonstration approach to transfer human hand-sewing skills to the robots. The human demonstrations were first observed by the vision module and then encoded using a statistical model to generate the reference motion trajectories. During autonomous robot sewing, the vision module plays the role of coordinating multirobot collaboration. Experimental results show that the robots can adapt to generalized stent designs. The proposed system can also be used for other manipulation tasks, especially for flexible production of customized products and where bimanual or multirobot cooperation is required. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
244	Location privacy protection based on differential privacy strategy for big data in industrial internet of things	In the research of location privacy protection, the existing methods are mostly based on the traditional anonymization, fuzzy and cryptography technology, and little success in the big data environment, for example, the sensor networks contain sensitive information, which is compulsory to be appropriately protected. Current trends, such as 'Industrie 4.0' and Internet of Things (IoT), generate, process, and exchange vast amounts of security-critical and privacy-sensitive data, which makes them attractive targets of attacks. However, previous methods overlooked the privacy protection issue, leading to privacy violation. In this paper, we propose a location privacy protection method that satisfies differential privacy constraint to protect location data privacy and maximizes the utility of data and algorithm in Industrial IoT. In view of the high value and low density of location data, we combine the utility with the privacy and build a multilevel location information tree model. Furthermore, the index mechanism of differential privacy is used to select data according to the tree node accessing frequency. Finally, the Laplace scheme is used to add noises to accessing frequency of the selecting data. As is shown in the theoretical analysis and the experimental results, the proposed strategy can achieve significant improvements in terms of security, privacy, and applicability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	186
245	A robust ECC-Based provable secure authentication protocol with privacy preserving for industrial internet of things	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play an important role in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and have been widely used in many industrial fields to gather data of monitoring area. However, due to the open nature of wireless channel and resource-constrained feature of sensor nodes, how to guarantee that the sensitive sensor data can only be accessed by a valid user becomes a key challenge in IIoT environment. Some user authentication protocols for WSNs have been proposed to address this issue. However, previous works more or less have their own weaknesses, such as not providing user anonymity and other ideal functions or being vulnerable to some attacks. To provide secure communication for IIoT, a user authentication protocol scheme with privacy protection for IIoT has been proposed. The security of the proposed scheme is proved under a random oracle model, and other security discussions show that the proposed protocol is robust to various attacks. Furthermore, the comparison results with other related protocols and the simulation by NS-3 show that the proposed protocol is secure and efficient for IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	223
246	Toward Energy-Awareness Smart Building: Discover the Fingerprint of Your Electrical Appliances	Energy efficiency raises significant concerns as it is one of the most promising ways to mitigate climate change. Disaggregation and identification of individual electrical appliances activities are one of the essentials for energy preservation especially for smart buildings. This paper proposes a lightweight electrical appliance activity detection approach for smart building, which leverages a single smart metering device to establish a learning and detection processing for multiple appliances. In this system, data interpolation and transition detection algorithm are proposed to effectively reduce the cost of model training and optimize the detection accuracy. The concept of appliance fingerprint is proposed and a variety of fingerprints, including appliance-based and context-based, are defined to depict fine-grained appliance characteristics. Based on these fingerprints, the paper proposes a multisource fingerprint-weighting KNN (FWKNN) classification algorithm and presents a boosting framework for continuous online learning and detection.

248	Energy-Efficient Vehicular Heterogeneous Networks for Green Cities	With the evolutionary development of automobile industry, modern transportation systems cause a series of critical problems, such as increased energy consumption and air pollution. To make green cities a reality, an ever expanding and evolving vehicular heterogeneous network infrastructure is required to enable fine-granularity data collection and reliable service delivery. In this paper, we investigate how to realize energy-efficient vehicular heterogeneous networks for green cities by exploring cooperative two-hop device-to-device-based vehicle-to-vehicle (D2D-V2V) transmission. We propose a two-stage energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm. In the first stage, an auction-matching-based joint relay selection, spectrum allocation, and power control algorithm is derived, which employs an English-auction approach for matching preference updating and conflict avoidance, and optimizes the energy efficiency of two-hop D2D-V2V and cellular links simultaneously in an iterative fashion. In the second stage, a nonlinear fractional programming based power control algorithm is developed to maximize the energy efficiency of the base station. Theoretical properties in terms of convergence, stability, and complexity are analyzed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated based on real-world road topology and realistic vehicular traffic. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of energy efficiency and network coverage compared to other heuristic algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	64

The problem addressed here is to find power estimators embedded in power sources (or embedded in access points provided in advance) and a power price controller such that the total power consumption tracks a given reference input. As a solution to this problem, we present power estimators with a consensus protocol and a proportional-integral type power price controller. We then show that our solution achieves the reference tracking of the total power consumption in a distributed manner. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
250	Small-Scale Renewable Energy Source Trading: A Contract Theory Approach	Energy informatics is expected to be significant to improve energy trading efficiency. In this framework, the cooperation among small-scale electricity suppliers and the efficient economic incentives to consumers play important roles to maximize the profits of each small-scale electricity supplier and a single aggregator. The aggregator first collects electricity from the suppliers and/or purchases electricity from the main macrogrid, then sells the electricity to the consumers. A coalitional game model in the presence of direct trading among suppliers is presented and a fair revenue division scheme based on the asymptotic Shapley value is derived. Moreover, an optimal contract-based scheme for electricity trading between the aggregator and consumers is proposed. The scheme enables the aggregator to generate more profits when it is for-profit and preferably supports it to serve all consumers when it is non-for-profit. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24

252	Improving RSSI-based path-loss models accuracy for critical infrastructures: A smart grid substation case-study	IoT is rapidly expanding to all productive sectors; however, as thousands of devices are envisioned to be deployed, a careful study of the radio spectrum (and its interferences) must be considered to predict and improve the network performance. In this sense, radio-channel characterization is essential; in particular, path-loss characterization allows to mathematically predict the propagation behavior and interferences of IoT devices with precision. In this paper, we show that by means of a set of mathematical corrections and measuring procedures, we can soundly employ the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), available in most IoT motes, to derive accurate path-loss models of industrial infrastructures. Experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme substantially improves the characterization accuracy of a real smart grid environment. This, in turn, is proven to have a measurable positive impact on the planning stage of an IoT network, whose life-of-time and cost analysis can be better anticipated. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	27
253	Collaborative Energy and Information Transfer in Green Wireless Sensor Networks for Smart Cities	Smart city is able to make the city source and infrastructure more efficiently utilized, which improves the quality of life for citizens. In this framework, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play an important role to collect, process, and analyze the corresponding information. However, the massive deployment of WSNs consumes a significant energy consumption, which has raised the growing demand for green WSNs for smart cities. Exploiting the recent advance in collaborative energy and information transfer to power the WSNs and transmit the data has been considered a promising approach to realize the green WSNs for smart cities. We propose an architecture design of the green WSNs for smart cities, by exploiting the collaborative energy and information transfer protocol, and illustrate the challenging issues in this design. To achieve a green system design, the sensor nodes in WSNs harvest the energy simultaneously with the information decoding (ID) from the received radio frequency signals. Specifically, the energy-constrained sensor nodes partition the received signals into two independent groups to perform energy harvesting (EH) and ID. The sensor nodes then use the harvested energy to amplify and forward the information signals. We study the joint optimization of subcarrier grouping, subcarrier pairing, and power allocation such that the transmission rate performance is maximized with the EH constraint. The joint optimization problem is solved via dual decomposition after transforming it into an equivalent convex optimization problem. Simulation results tested with the real WSNs system data indicate that the performance of our proposed protocol can be significantly improved. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	115
254	A High-Precision Loose Strands Diagnosis Approach for Isoelectric Line in High-Speed Railway	The isoelectric line is an important component that connects the steady arm and the drop bracket of catenary in high-speed railway. The loose strands of isoelectric line can be commonly observed in real-life applications. In this paper, an automatic fault detection system for the loose strands of the isoelectric line is proposed. This system consists of three stages. First, a convolutional neural network is adopted to extract the isoelectric line features. To accurately and quickly learn these features, an improved feature extraction network, called as the isoelectric line network, is presented. Using the images captured from catenary inspection vehicles, the image areas that contain the isoelectric lines are obtained based on the Faster region-based convolutional neural network. Second, the image segmentation is carried out based on the Markov random field model. And, the accurate isoelectric line pixels are obtained from the smallest image area extracted from the first stage. In the final stage, the fault state is given by analyzing the quantity of the independent connection regions and the pixels' standard deviation. Experimental results show that the proposed system has a high detection accuracy. Furthermore, compared with the convolutional neural networks (the Simonyan and Zisserman model and the Zeiler and Fergus model) and a typical detection method (Histogram of Oriented Gradient + Support Vector Machine), the proposed network has better performance for the isoelectric line location. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	61
255	Automatic Procedure Following Evaluation Using Petri Net-Based Workflows	An operating procedure (OP), also known as checklist or action plan, is a list of actions or criteria arranged in a systematic way, commonly used in areas such as aviation or healthcare to ensure the success of critical tasks and to help decrease human errors. In these areas, operators are hardly trained to follow the OP carefully, but the evaluation of how they are following, it is usually performed manually by an expert instructor. Automating this evaluation process would lead to an objective and scalable analysis of the operator performance, which is extremely important in areas where the number of operators to evaluate is high. This problem, which can be referred as automatic procedure following evaluation, needs of new techniques and formalizations due to current conformance checking methods do not fit well with some aspects of a OP. In this paper, OPs are modeled as Petri Net-based workflows, and interact with the data log of the system to allow an automatic evaluation of the progress and time spent following the OP. In order to illustrate the contributions of this paper, a case study is carried out designing and modeling an emergency OP for an unmanned aircraft system, and evaluating the proposed approach with a battery of tests. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6

New comfort features, safety functions, and a number of new vehicle-specific services will be integrated in future smart vehicles. These include a fast, secure, and reliable way to diagnose and reconfigure a vehicle, as well as the installation of new software (SW) on its integrated electronic control units (ECUs). Such wireless SW updates are beneficial for both automotive carmakers and customers, as they allow us to securely enable new features on the vehicle and to fix SW bugs by installing a new SW version over the air. A secure and dependable wireless SW update process is valuable in the entire lifetime of a modern vehicle as it can be used already during vehicle development and manufacturing process on the assembly line, as well as during vehicle maintenance in a service center. Additionally, future vehicles will allow us to remotely download up-to-date SW on the ECUs. To support this process over the entire vehicle's lifetime, a generic framework is needed. In this paper, SecUp, a generic framework enabling secure and efficient wireless automotive SW updates is proposed. SecUp utilizes IEEE 802.11s as wireless medium to interconnect vehicles and diagnostic devices in a dependable and fast way.

257	A PSSS approach for wireless industrial communication applying iterative symbol detection	Wireless industrial communication requires high reliability and low latencies. In order to fulfill both requirements simultaneously, wireless approaches are being developed. One of these technologies is parallel sequence spread spectrum (PSSS). In comparison to direct sequence spread spectrum approaches, which employ a set of appropriate pseudonoise (PN) sequences, PSSS data symbols are spread based on a single cyclically shifted m -sequence. Each cyclic shift of the chosen m-sequence is used as an individual PN-sequence. This enables a code division multiple access (CDMA) scheme with simple processing and thus, a fast hardware implementation. In order to investigate the impact of an inaccurate time synchronization, this paper presents a theoretical and simulative PSSS evaluation. Moreover, an iterative symbol detection is introduced, which neutralizes the impact of the nonorthogonal m-sequences and mitigates the degradation due to inaccurate synchronization. In addition, several reasonable resource allocation schemes are presented, which emphasize the PSSS systems flexibility. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	17
258	Temperature-resilient time synchronization for the internet of things	Networks deployed in real-world conditions have to cope with dynamic, unpredictable environmental temperature changes. These changes affect the clock rate on network nodes, and can cause faster clock de-synchronization compared to situations where devices are operating under stable temperature conditions. Wireless network protocols, such as time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) from the IEEE 802.15.4-2015 standard, are affected by this problem, since they require tight clock synchronization among all nodes for the network to remain operational. This paper proposes a method for autonomously compensating temperature-dependent clock rate changes. After a calibration stage, nodes continuously perform temperature measurements to compensate for clock drifts at runtime. The method is implemented on low-power Internet of Things (IoT) nodes and evaluated through experiments in a temperature chamber, indoor and outdoor environments, as well as with numerical simulations. The results show that applying the method reduces the maximum synchronization error more than ten times. In this way, the method allows reduction in the total energy spent for time synchronization, which is practically relevant concern for low data rate, low energy budget TSCH networks, especially those exposed to environments with changing temperature. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21

In spite of its benefits, new application scenarios and new system architecture expose the D2D group communications to unique security threats. Although there are numerous studies on security and privacy in two-user D2D communications, a lack of solutions on secure and privacy-preserving D2D group communications would restrict their wide usage. In this paper, we propose two privacy-preserving authentication and key Agreement protocols (PPAKA-HAMC and PPAKA-IBS) to guarantee secure and anonymous D2D group communications. In our protocols, a group of D2D users mutually authenticate with each other without leaking their identity information while negotiate a common D2D group session key for secure communications in a D2D session.

260	EMOGA: A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm with Extremal Optimization Core for Multiobjective Disassembly Line Balancing	In a world where products get obsolescent ever more quickly, discarded devices produce million tons of electronic waste. Improving how end-of-life products are dismantled helps reduce this waste, as resources are conserved and fed back into the supply chain, thereby promoting reuse and recycling. This paper presents the Extremal MultiObjective Genetic Algorithm (EMOGA), a hybrid nature-inspired optimization technique for a multiobjective version of the disassembly line balancing problem. The aim is to minimize the number of workstations, and to maximize profit and disassembly depth, when dismounting products in disassembly lines. EMOGA is a Pareto-based genetic algorithm hybridized with a module based on extremal optimization, which uses a tailored mutation operator and a continuous relaxation-based seeding technique. The experiments involved the disassembly of a hammer drill and a microwave oven. Performance evaluation was carried out by comparing EMOGA to various efficient algorithms.

262	Multiobjective optimization for demand side management program in smart grid	Demand side management (DSM) plays an important role in smart grid for paving the way to a low-carbon future. In this paper, a hierarchical day-Ahead DSM model is proposed, where renewable energy sources are integrated. The proposed model consists of three layers: The utility in the upper layer, the demand response (DR) aggregator in the middle layer, and customers in the lower layer. The utility seeks to minimize the operation cost and give part of the revenue to the DR aggregator as a bonus. The DR aggregator acts as an intermediary, receiving bonus from the utility and giving compensation to customers for modifying their energy usage pattern. The aim of the DR aggregator is to maximize its net benefit. Customers desire to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the received compensation minus the dissatisfactory level. To achieve these objectives, a multiobjective problem is formulated. An artificial immune algorithm is used to solve this problem, leading to a Pareto optimal set. Using a selection criterion, a Pareto optimal solution can be selected, which does not favour any particular participant to ensure the overall fairness. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of the proposed method: The utility can reduce the operation cost and the peak to average ratio; the DR aggregator can make a profit for providing DSM services; and customers can reduce their bill. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	71
263	Intelligent Range-Only Mapping and Navigation for Mobile Robots	Addressing the navigation (localization and motion control) problem of a mobile robot, coupled with its mapping problem, remains a significant challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literature without specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18

266	Incremental flow scheduling and routing in time-sensitive software-defined networks	Several networking architectures have been developed atop IEEE 802.3 networks to provide real-time communication guarantees for time-sensitive applications in industrial automation systems. The basic principle underlying these technologies is the precise transmission scheduling of time-triggered traffic through the network for providing deterministic and bounded latency and jitter. These transmission schedules are typically synthesized offline (computational time in the order of hours) and remain fixed thereafter, making it difficult to dynamically add or remove network applications. This paper presents algorithms for incrementally adding time-triggered flows in a time-sensitive software-defined network (TSSDN). The TSSDN is a network architecture based on software-defined networking, which provides real-time guarantees for time-triggered flows by scheduling their transmissions on the hosts (network edge) only. These algorithms exploit the global view of the control plane on the data plane to schedule and route time-triggered flows needed for the dynamic applications in the Industrial Internet of Things (Industry 4.0). The evaluations show that these algorithms can compute incremental schedules for time-triggered flows in subseconds with an average relative optimality of 68%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	94

268	Adaptive Scheduling in Energy Harvesting Sensor Networks for Green Cities	This paper studies energy harvesting sensor networks in green cities that transmit a variety of data packets with different reward values. With the aim to maximize its long-term average transmission reward, almost all the existing optimal energy management strategies are based on the policy iteration algorithm, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality. By contrast, we focus on developing low-complexity optimal policies that can lead to practical implementation. Our main contribution is to propose a threshold-based scheduling policy for energy harvesting sensor networks achieving long-term average rewards. As a result, a sensor node only requires limited memory to store a few optimal value thresholds to perform energy management. Specifically, we propose an algorithm to compute the optimal thresholds, whose complexity is linear with the size of data and energy storage. Numerical results are studied based on real solar radiation data measured at Queensland and show that the optimal expected reward of our proposed scheduling policy approaches its theoretical offline upper bound. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

270	Covariance Intersection in Track-to-Track Fusion: Comparison of Fusion Configurations	Tracking and localization are typical application fields of estimation fusion algorithms. Multiple sensor nodes can collaborate by sharing estimates of, e.g., the position and velocity of a target. This paper compares several fusion configurations, which are distinguished by the communication rate, the information feedback type, and the use of memory. The attention is focused on communicationally cheap suboptimal solutions that avoid the computation of the cross-correlations of estimation errors by considering all admissible cross-correlations.

271	Power peak shaving with data transmission delays for thermal management in smart buildings	This paper presents a scheme aimed at mitigating the influence of random data transmission delays in networked thermal appliance control systems in smart buildings. The impact of this type of delays is first analyzed, and it is proposed to utilize loose timing synchronization and add blank gaps between the consecutive appliance operations to avoid the possible violation of the given power budget. A cooperative control of thermal appliance operation is developed using a networked model predictive control-based controller to deal with delays. It is also shown that the schedulability of such a control scheme can be assessed online. The performance of the proposed control scheme is assessed by a simulation study based on the thermal dynamics of an eight-room office building. The obtained results show that the proposed solution can achieve an efficient power peaks shaving in the presence of random network delays. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
272	Topology control strategy for movable sensor networks in ultradeep shafts	Ultradeep shafts are the only means available to extract solid mineral resources from deep within the earth, and the conditions of these shafts directly affect the working safety of the lifting system. Chain-type wireless sensor networks (CWSNs), which are mobile and self-supporting, provide a new option for mobile collaborative monitoring of ultradeep shafts by sampling panoramic images. In this paper, a topological control method for CWSNs in an ultradeep shaft based on mobile sensor nodes is proposed. First, a video sensor node that can vertically climb a rope and automatically generate power is designed. Then, a uniform chain-type deployment strategy is proposed to accommodate the actual conditions of an ultradeep shaft. Ultimately, the network repair strategies based on mobile nodes are designed to address node movement and communication failures. The research results indicate that a uniform hierarchical deployment algorithm with a scheduling strategy can achieve overall monitoring of the ultradeep shaft in a monitoring cycle and that the collaborative repair strategy can effectively maintain the linear-domain coverage of the network. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
273	Demand-Side Regulation Provision From Industrial Loads Integrated With Solar PV Panels and Energy Storage System for Ancillary Services	Nowadays, enabled by current smart grid technology, electricity consumers can play an active role in providing ancillary service (AS) as a type of demand response. Participating AS can assist stabilizing the power grid by following the frequency regulation signal, or dynamic regulation signal (RegD) in this study while receiving economic benefits. Industrial loads are an indispensable component as a demand-side regulating resource of ancillary service due to their intensive electricity consumption. In this paper, we use grid-connected solar photovoltaics panels combined with the energy storage system (ESS) to produce continuous electricity consumption signals in order to follow the RegD signal. The participation of solar energy in real-time regulation provision process is emphasized, which is modeled based on a variety of operation modes in accordance to Australian Standard. Through a particular case study, with the integration of solar energy, the proposed method poses cost-effectiveness in industrial plant scheduling and a favorable load following capability, helping ensure the frequency stability of the electric grid. The proposed methodology is more economically advantageous compared to identical industrial loads only equipped with on-site ESS, and requires less switchings on machines compared to industrial plants with passive use of solar energy. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	45
274	Extended Semantic Annotations for Generating Translators in the Arrowhead Framework	In order to create distributed automation systems, it is required to ensure their interoperability; however, ensuring interoperability between heterogeneous systems (using different communication protocols, data formats, and semantics) is a challenging task. Among many interoperability challenges, this paper addresses issues concerning semantic and data interoperability, namely, it provides a contribution to support the semantic compatibility verification and the generation of translators for XML messages. Translators are generated based on XML-schemas that are annotated with a reference ontology. We base our annotations on an extension of an existing declarative annotation method. In particular, our extension explicitly addresses ambiguities of annotations, schema instance mismatches, and coverage mismatches that frequently occur on Internet-of-things message schemas. We have evaluated our approach based on a set of interaction scenarios from the domain of the Arrowhead Project. A tool prototype that supports the semantic compatibility verification and the generation of XML translators is available at http://gres.uninova.pt/tag/. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
275	Internet-of-Things Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation Architecture for Providing Frequency Regulation with Demand Response	Following recent advances in network infrastructure, cloud computing, and embedded systems, fascinating work is underway exploring the utility of demand response in increasing grid stability while permitting high penetration of intermittent renewable distributed generation resources. Although works have demonstrated diverse theoretical advantages of demand response programs, little real-world data are available and utilities generally remain reticent in moving forward with large-scale implementation due to risks inherent to any modification of the power system. Deciding that the next pertinent step in bringing demand response from theory to technology is developing an Internet-of-things hardware-in-the-loop simulation power system integrated device capable of empirically testing the theoretical mechanisms, this work presents an architecture testbed for providing demand response (telemetric monitoring and actuation of loads), which is real node in a power system simulation where virtual node's parameters derive real node data.

276	Learning-Based Energy-Efficient Data Collection by Unmanned Vehicles in Smart Cities	Mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) is now an important source of information for smart cities, especially with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and driverless cars. They are equipped with different kinds of high-precision sensors, and can be scheduled/controlled completely during data collection, which will make MCS system more robust. However, they are limited to energy constraint, especially for long-term, long-distance sensing tasks, and cities are almost too crowded to set stationary charging station. Towards this end, in this paper we propose to leverage emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for enabling model-free unmanned vehicles control, and present a novel and highly effective control framework, called 'DRL-RVC.' It utilizes the powerful convolutional neural network for feature extraction of the necessary information (including sample distribution, traffic flow, etc.), then makes decisions under the guidance of the deep Q network. That is, UAVs will cruise in the city without control and collect most required data in the sensing region, while mobile unmanned charging station will reach the charging point in the shortest possible time. Finally, we validate and evaluate the proposed framework via extensive simulations based on a real dataset in Rome. Extensive simulation results well justify the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	108
277	Greening the Smart Cities: Energy-Efficient Massive Content Delivery via D2D Communications	Massive multimedia services have been considered as one the most prominent characteristics for smart cities. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient content delivery system via the device-to-device communications, which realizes the large-scale content delivery among mobile devices with constrained energy, unpredictable demand, limited storage, random mobility, and opportunistic transmission. The highlights of this paper lie in two parts. On the theoretical end, through exploring the relationship among the coding, storage, and transmission, a systematic energy-saving content delivery fashion is investigated. On the technical end, a totally distributed content delivery system is designed in a simple and efficient manner, in which each device only utilizes local information to make decisions and implements its own scheme individually. Importantly, the proposed scheme is realized in a practical smart city system, and numerical results demonstrate that it is flexible to various users' needs and communication environments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	117
278	Wide and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Electricity-Theft Detection to Secure Smart Grids	Electricity theft is harmful to power grids. Integrating information flows with energy flows, smart grids can help to solve the problem of electricity theft owning to the availability of massive data generated from smart grids. The data analysis on the data of smart grids is helpful in detecting electricity theft because of the abnormal electricity consumption pattern of energy thieves. However, the existing methods have poor detection accuracy of electricity theft since most of them were conducted on one-dimensional (1-D) electricity consumption data and failed to capture the periodicity of electricity consumption. In this paper, we originally propose a novel electricity-theft detection method based on wide and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to address the above concerns. In particular, wide and deep CNN model consists of two components: the wide component and the deep CNN component. The deep CNN component can accurately identify the nonperiodicity of electricity theft and the periodicity of normal electricity usage based on 2-D electricity consumption data. Meanwhile, the wide component can capture the global features of 1-D electricity consumption data. As a result, wide and deep CNN model can achieve the excellent performance in electricity-theft detection. Extensive experiments based on realistic dataset show that wide and deep CNN model outperforms other existing methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	305

280	Consortium blockchain for secure energy trading in industrial internet of things	In industrial Internet of things (IIoT), peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading ubiquitously takes place in various scenarios, e.g., microgrids, energy harvesting networks, and vehicle-to-grid networks. However, there are common security and privacy challenges caused by untrusted and nontransparent energy markets in these scenarios. To address the security challenges, we exploit the consortium blockchain technology to propose a secure energy trading system named energy blockchain. This energy blockchain can be widely used in general scenarios of P2P energy trading getting rid of a trusted intermediary. Besides, to reduce the transaction limitation resulted from transaction confirmation delays on the energy blockchain, we propose a credit-based payment scheme to support fast and frequent energy trading. An optimal pricing strategy using Stackelberg game for credit-based loans is also proposed. Security analysis and numerical results based on a real dataset illustrate that the proposed energy blockchain and credit-based payment scheme are secure and efficient in IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	646
281	On threshold-free error detection for industrial wireless sensor networks	One of the important sources for big data is the datasets collected by wireless sensor networks. However, errors in sensor data could result in serious damages in industrial applications. Therefore, error detection plays a crucial role in industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs). Existing approaches of error detection are generally threshold-based, which rely on a predetermined threshold to judge whether a reading is erroneous. The threshold-based approaches, however, often fail to balance between detection accuracy and false alarm rate. It is thus difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a proper threshold for various errors in real-world applications. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel threshold-free error detection approach for IWSNs. By taking the advantage of the spatiotemporal correlations between sensor readings, we present the model to characterize the relationship between sensor pairs and, thus, construct a correlation graph for IWSN. In the correlation graph, the states of nodes, i.e., the states of sensor readings, are accurately exploited without requiring any threshold. Through the experiments on both real sensors and simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to significantly improve the detection accuracy while largely reducing the false alarm rate. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24
282	Joint Load Scheduling and Voltage Regulation in the Distribution System with Renewable Generators	By equipping with the advanced smart meters and two-way communications infrastructure, smart grids, as a key component of future smart cities, are able to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the energy cost through real-time monitoring and customer load scheduling. However, the high penetration of intermittent renewable energy such as solar power may cause frequent overvoltage and undervoltage problems at certain buses, making the load scheduling face new challenges on voltage regulation. In this paper, we investigate the impact of voltage constraints on load scheduling by power flow analysis in a power distribution system with renewable generators. A voltage regulator (VR) is introduced to regulate the voltage of buses in the distribution system and assist load scheduling. To jointly minimize the cost and stabilize the voltages of the distribution system, we propose a grid-customer coordinated load scheduling strategy, which simultaneously determines the tap changes of the VR and scheduling of customer electricity loads in each time slot. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy based on realistic power demand and renewable energy generation datasets. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can remarkably reduce the energy cost and stabilize the voltage fluctuation of distribution systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
283	Green Wi-Fi Implementation and Management in Dense Autonomous Environments for Smart Cities	Advanced informatics technologies facilitate the construction of green smart cities, especially the Wi-Fi implementation and management, for rapidly increasing personal Wi-Fi devices in autonomous environments residing in nonoverlapped channels often result in low energy efficiency and severe cochannel interference. In this paper, a green Wi-Fi management framework is constructed in order to reduce the overall energy consumption through turning off a portion of access points (APs) and aggregating their users to the other active APs. A Tabu-search-assisted active AP selection algorithm is proposed to minimize the power consumption with a seamless wireless converge. For the active APs, based on our defined metric airtime cost that is integrated by the in-range interference and the hidden terminal interference, a reinforcement-learning-aided AP self-management algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust APs' channels in the partially overlapped channel space. Extensive simulations and field experiments demonstrate that the power consumption can be reduced by about 65%, and the airtime cost of APs can be reduced by 50% compared with the typical least congestion channel search algorithm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
284	A Model-Driven Engineering Workbench for CAEX Supporting Language Customization and Evolution	Computer Aided Engineering Exchange (CAEX) is one of the most promising standards when it comes to data exchange between engineering tools in the production system automation domain. This is also reflected by the current emergence of AutomationML (AML), which uses CAEX as its core representation language. However, with the increasing use of CAEX, important language engineering challenges arise. One of these challenges is the customization of CAEX for its usage in superior standards, such as AML, which requires the precise specification of the language including the formalization and validation of additional usage rules. Another highly topical challenge is the ongoing evolution of CAEX as has recently happened with the transition from version 2.15 to version 3.0. Further challenges include the provisioning of editing facilities and visualizations of CAEX documents such that they can be inspected and modified by engineers, and the development of transformations from and to CAEX such that different engineering artifacts can be exchanged via CAEX. In this paper, we take a language engineering point of view and present a model-driven engineering (MDE) workbench for CAEX that allows to address these and other challenges. In particular, we present how CAEX can be formulated in a model-based framework, which allows the application of MDE techniques, such as model validation, migration, editing, visualization, and transformation techniques, to solve a diverse set of language engineering challenges experienced for CAEX. We give an overview of the developed workbench and illustrate its benefits with a focus on customizing CAEX for AML and evolving CAEX documents from version 2.15 to 3.0. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
285	Designing Dynamic and Collaborative Automation and Robotics Software Systems	The heterogeneity of execution platforms and operating software in manufacturing machines and robots, as well as various sensors and actuators, creates challenges for integration into larger systems. Existing approaches make use of different types of middleware to mitigate the challenges of designing interoperable systems. However, middleware can significantly impede modular design and composition of software systems that are dynamic in nature. This paper elaborates upon those challenges and proposes using an approach called service-oriented SystemJ (SOSJ), based on the system-level programming language SystemJ enhanced with service oriented features. This approach allows developers to design dynamic software systems while adopting and incorporating legacy solutions. The approach is demonstrated on the integration of an industrial automation system, incorporating the use of multiple modular mechatronics stations and service robotics systems, represented by robot operating system-enabled Baxter robots. The proposed approach offers a simple service interface based on abstract objects for integrating robots and automation machines in the SOSJ world, without the need to modify the underlying mechatronics or robotics systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15

287	Certificateless searchable public key encryption scheme for industrial internet of things	With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things and cloud computing in different industry sectors, an increasing number of individuals or organizations are outsourcing their Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data in the cloud server to achieve cost saving and collaboration (e.g., data sharing). However, in this environment, preserving the privacy of data remains a key challenge and inhibiting factor to an even wider adoption of IIoT in the cloud environment. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we design a new secure channel-free certificateless searchable public key encryption with multiple keywords scheme for IIoT deployment. We then demonstrate the security of the scheme in the random oracle model against two types of adversaries, where one adversary is given the power to choose a random public key instead of any user's public key and another adversary is allowed to learn the system master key. In the presence of these types of adversaries, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and demonstrate that it achieves (computational) efficiency with low communication cost. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	162

In this paper, we investigate big urban traffic data to characterize essential features of urban mobility and construct large-scale green urban mobility models. We exploit the road and traffic information to enhance the trip generation algorithm and traffic assignment technique based on the weighted segments of roads. Besides, we perform extensive observations and corrections on the OpenStreetMap imported to simulation of urban mobility to make it analogous to real-world road topology.

289	Lightweight searchable public-key encryption for cloud-assisted wireless sensor networks	The industrial Internet of Things is flourishing, which is unprecedentedly driven by the rapid development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with the assistance of cloud computing. The new wave of technology will give rise to new risks to cyber security, particularly the data confidentiality in cloud-assisted WSNs (CWSNs). Searchable public-key encryption (SPE) is a promising method to address this problem. In theory, it allows sensors to upload public-key ciphertexts to the cloud, and the owner of these sensors can securely delegate a keyword search to the cloud and retrieve the intended data while maintaining data confidentiality. However, all existing and semantically secure SPE schemes have expensive costs in terms of generating ciphertexts and searching keywords. Hence, this paper proposes a lightweight SPE (LSPE) scheme with semantic security for CWSNs. LSPE reduces a large number of the computation-intensive operations that are adopted in previous works; thus, LSPE has search performance close to that of some practical searchable symmetric encryption schemes. In addition, LSPE saves considerable time and energy costs of sensors for generating ciphertexts. Finally, we experimentally test LSPE and compare the results with some previous works to quantitatively demonstrate the above advantages. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	64

291	Adaptive Learning Hybrid Model for Solar Intensity Forecasting	Energy management is indispensable in the smart grid, which integrates more renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind. Because of the intermittent power generation from these resources, precise power forecasting has become crucial to achieve efficient energy management. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive learning hybrid model (ALHM) for precise solar intensity forecasting based on meteorological data. We first present a time-varying multiple linear model (TMLM) to capture the linear and dynamic property of the data. We then construct simultaneous confidence bands for variable selection. Next, we apply the genetic algorithm back propagation neural network (GABP) to learn the nonlinear relationships in the data. We further propose ALHM by integrating TMLM, GABP, and the adaptive learning online hybrid algorithm. The proposed ALHM captures the linear, temporal, and nonlinear relationships in the data, and keeps improving the predicting performance adaptively online as more data are collected. Simulation results show that ALHM outperforms several benchmarks in both short-term and long-term solar intensity forecasting. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	45
292	Auction Mechanisms for Energy Trading in Multi-Energy Systems	In green cities, one of the most promising energy system designs is the multi-energy system, which is capable of integrating different energy resources to supply stable energy for users. To schedule diverse energy efficiently, the energy trading among different energy entities is a big issue in multi-energy systems. This paper proposes auction mechanisms for energy trading in a smart multi-energy district, in which the district manager sells electricity, natural gas, and heating energy to users and meanwhile trades with outer energy networks. Two auction mechanisms are designed under the day-ahead and real-time markets, respectively. For each auction, energy allocation is optimized by solving a social welfare maximization problem, which is strictly subject to constraints of physical multi-energy system models. It is theoretically proven that both auctions are able to guarantee the properties of economic efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality. With these properties, users are incentivized to participate into the auctions with fairness. Finally, real data are adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanisms. The theoretic analysis of the properties is verified as well. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	70

Safety critical applications usually demand rigorously formal verification to ensure correctness. But for the increasing complexity of dynamic environments and applications, it is not easy to build a comprehensive model for the traditional offline verification. In this paper, we propose RobotRV, the first data-centered real-time verification approach for the robot system. Within this approach, a domain-specific language named RoboticSpec is designed to specify the complex application scenario of the robot system, the data packets transmitted in the robot system, and the safety critical temporal properties. Then, we develop an engine to automatically translate the RoboticSpec model into a real-time verifier. The generated verifier serves as an independent plug-in component for the runtime verification of concerned temporal properties. We applied the proposed approach to a real robot system.

294	Energy-Efficient Device-to-Device Communications for Green Smart Cities	To afford effective service of real-time monitoring and responses for smart cities, it is desired to provide ubiquitous network connections and high data rate services. However, the huge demands for ubiquitous high data rate wireless communications have caused a sharp increase in energy consumption and green house gas emission. In order to realize a sustainable smart city, it is critical to incorporate green communication technique into smart city developments. Device-to-device (D2D) communication has been recognized as one of the key technologies to improve data rate and reduce power consumption, which allows two physically nearby located user equipments to communicate directly with each other. In this paper, with the target of achieving green communications through D2D, we investigate the joint optimization of uplink subcarrier assignment (SA) and power allocation (PA) in D2D underlying cellular networks. Specifically, the problem formulation is to minimize the energy cost of all users in the system while guaranteeing the required data rate of both the D2D user equipments (DUEs) and cellular user equipments. Such an optimization problem is in general a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem that is NP-hard. To make this problem tractable, we decompose it into the SA and PA subproblems. In particular, we design a heuristic algorithm to assign subcarrier by assuming that the transmit power is evenly allocated over all subcarriers. After that, we solve the PA subproblem by exploiting the difference between the concave function (D.C.) structure of the constraints and transform it into a convex optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate the remarkable improvement in terms of power consumption by using our algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	62
295	Power Market Load Forecasting on Neural Network With Beneficial Correlated Regularization	In day-ahead market (DAM), load serving entities (LSEs) are required to submit their future load schedule to market operator. Due to the cost computation, we have found the inconformity between load accuracy and cost of power purchase. It means that more accurate load forecasting model may not lead to a lower cost for LSEs. Accuracy pursuing load forecast model may not target a solution with optimal benefit. Facing this issue, this paper initiates a beneficial correlated regularization (BCR) for neural network (NN) load prediction. The training target of NN contains both accuracy section and power cost section. Also, this paper establishes a virtual neuron and a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for network training. A numerical study with practical data is presented and the result shows that NN with BCR can reduce power cost with acceptable accuracy level. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	28
296	SDN-Enabled Multi-Attribute-Based Secure Communication for Smart Grid in IIoT Environment	Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is an emerging technology with a large number of smart connected devices having sensing, storage, and computing capabilities. IIoT is used in a wide range of applications such as transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and energy management in smart grids. Most of the solutions reported in the literature for secure communications are not suitable for the aforementioned applications due to the usage of traditional TCP/IP-based network infrastructure. So, to handle this challenge, in this paper, a software-defined network (SDN) enabled multi-attribute secure communication model for an IIoT environment is designed. The proposed scheme works in three phases: 1) an SDN-IIoT communication model is designed using a cuckoo-filter-based fast-forwarding scheme, 2) an attribute-based encryption scheme is presented for secure data communication, and 3) a peer entity authentication scheme using a third party authenticator, Kerberos , is also presented.

297	Optimal Price Based Demand Response of HVAC Systems in Multizone Office Buildings Considering Thermal Preferences of Individual Occupants Buildings	Thermal energy capacity of buildings can be coupled to power networks via heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) units. Optimizing the operation of HVAC systems in multizone buildings is a challenging task, as occupants have different thermal preferences dependent on time-varying indoor and outdoor environments. To estimate the social cost of demand response (DR), building aggregators need to assess occupants' thermal discomfort (TD), which is related to their productivity outcomes. This paper proposes a price-based DR strategy for multizone office buildings to co-optimize the energy cost of HVAC units and the TD levels of occupants. To overcome simplified TD representations, a mobile interface is developed that grants occupants the ability to indicate their personal thermal preferences. These preferences are modeled using artificial neural networks, which are explicitly and directly integrated into the optimal DR scheduling. In addition, we evaluate the thermal response of a multizone office building to the operation of a variable speed heat pump (VSHP). Using the models of occupants' TD and building thermal response, the optimization problem for the proposed DR strategy is formulated and solved with mixed-integer linear programming. The case study results verify that the proposed strategy successfully optimizes VSHP operations and occupants' TD levels, mitigating the risk of occupant interruption to the optimal DR schedule. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	48
298	Probabilistic per-packet real-time guarantees for wireless networked sensing and control	The mission-critical nature of wireless networked sensing and control (WSC) systems, such as the control of industrial plants, requires stringent real-time delivery of packets. Due to inherent dynamics and uncertainties in wireless communication, real-time communication guarantees are probabilistic in nature. In this paper, a probabilistic framework is therefore proposed for per-packet real-time delivery guarantee. The notion of real-time in this paper differs from the existing work in the sense that it ensures, in an execution history of arbitrary length, every packet is successfully delivered before its deadline with a probability no less than a user-specified threshold (e.g., 99%). The framework has several novel building blocks: First, 'R3 (requirement-reliability-resource) mapping' translates the upper layer probabilistic real-time communication requirement, and the lower layer links reliability into the resource (i.e., optimal number of transmission opportunities) reserved for each packet. Second, 'EDF (earliest deadline first) based real-time scheduling' as well as the 'admission test' and 'traffic load optimization' maximize system utility while satisfying per-packet real-time communication requirements. The proposed admission test is proved to be both sufficient and necessary, and the simulation results show that the proposed framework ensures probabilistic per-packet real-time communication. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10

For example, personal medical privacy data can be easily leaked to insurance companies, which not only compromises the privacy of individuals, but also hinders the healthy development of the medical industry. With the continuous improvement of cloud computing and big data technologies, the Internet of Things technology has been rapidly developed. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is one of the core technologies of the Internet of Things. The application of the RFID system to the medical system can effectively solve this problem of medical privacy. RFID tags in the system can collect useful information and conduct data exchange and processing with a back-end server through the reader.

300	Provably secure and lightweight certificateless signature scheme for IIoT environments	In recent years, two technologies, the cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), have a synergistic effect in the modern organizations as digitization is a new business trend for various industries. Therefore, many organizations outsource their crowdsourced industrial-IoT (IIoT) data in the cloud system to reduce data management overhead. However, data authentication is one of the fundamental security/trust requirements in such IIoT network. The certificateless signature (CLS) scheme is a cryptographic primitive that provides data authenticity in IIoT systems. Recently, CLS has become a prime research focus due to its ability to solve the key-escrow problem in a very recent identity-based signature technique. Many CLS schemes have already been developed using map-to-point (MTP) hash function and random oracle model (ROM). However, due to the implementation difficulty and probabilistic nature of MTP function and ROM, those CLSs are impractical. Hence, the development of a CLS for lightweight devices mounted in IIoT has become one of the most focused research trends. This paper presents a new pairing-based CLS scheme without MTP function and ROM. The new CLS scheme is secure against both the Type-I and Type-II adversaries under the hardness of extended bilinear strong Diffie-Hellman (BSDH) and BSDH assumptions, respectively. Performance evaluation and comparison proves that our scheme outperforms other CLS schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	121

302	Cloud-orchestrated physical topology discovery of large-scale IoT systems using UAVs	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been rapidly integrated into Internet of Things (IoT) systems, empowering rich and diverse applications such as large-scale environment monitoring. However, due to the random deployment of sensor nodes (SNs), physical topology of the WSNs cannot be controlled and typically remains unknown to the IoT cloud server. Therefore, in order to derive the physical topology at the cloud for effective real-time event detection, a cloud-orchestrated physical topology discovery scheme for large-scale IoT systems using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed in this paper. More specifically, the large-scale monitoring area is first split into a number of subregions for UAV-enabled data collection. Within the subregions, parallel Metropolis-Hastings random walk (MHRW) is developed to gather the information of WSN nodes, including their IDs and neighbor tables. The collected information is then forwarded to the cloud through UAVs for the initial generation of logical topology. Thereafter, a network-wide 3-D localization algorithm is further developed based on the discovered logical topology and multidimensional scaling method (Topo-MDS), where the UAVs equipped with global positioning system are served as mobile anchors to locate the SNs. Simulation results indicate that the parallel MHRW improves both the efficiency and accuracy of logical topology discovery. In addition, the Topo-MDS algorithm dramatically improves the 3-D location accuracy, as compared to the existing algorithms in the literature. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	32
303	Green Survivable Collaborative Edge Computing in Smart Cities	As an integrated environment deployed with wired and wireless infrastructures, the smart city heavily relies on the wireless-optical broadband access network. The information flows captured by indoor devices are sent to optical network units through front-end wireless mesh sensor networks (WMNs) and, finally, reach the optical line terminal for industrial/commercial decision making via the passive optical network backhaul. To reduce the backhaul bandwidth saturated by this conventional approach, edge devices are deployed at the front-end WMN to preprocess information flows. Based on collaborative edge computing, home users or factory workers customize their computing services as virtual networks embedded onto the common WMN. In this paper, we propose the green survivable virtual network embedding for the collaborative edge computing in smart cities. We mathematically formulate the problem and derive the corresponding bound.

304	A Bi-Level Control for Energy Efficiency Improvement of a Hybrid Tracked Vehicle	In this paper, a bi-level control framework is proposed to improve the energy efficiency for a hybrid tracked vehicle. The higher-level discusses how to accurately predict power demand based on the Markov Chain. Specially, fuzzy encoding predictor is used for power demand prediction, and a real-time recursive algorithm is applied to fuse the future power demand information into transition probability matrix (TPM) computation. Furthermore, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence rate is employed to decide the alteration of control strategy. The lower-level computes the relevant energy management strategy, based on the updated TPM and a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) technique. Simulation results illustrate that the vehicular energy efficiency in the proposed scheme exceeds the common RL control by tuning the KL divergence value. Comparative results also show that the developed control strategy outperforms the common RL one, in terms of energy efficiency and computational speed. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	59

306	Interpolation of a Clothoid Curve Based on Iterative True-Value Prediction Considering the Discretization Error	Computerized numerical control (CNC) systems are widely used in the processing field. The key technology of these systems is the interpolation that connects the desired points. The interpolation using a clothoid curve is one of the effective methods for connecting the points because of its outstanding smoothness properties. A clothoid curve is a spatial function. Hence, synthesization with a time function is necessary to apply the curve for the actual CNC equipment. The clothoid curve can be easily synthesized with a time function by designing the tangential velocity as the time function. However, a numerical calculation is necessary because the clothoid curve has a limitation in that it does not have an analytical expression. Therefore, the discretization error of the numerical calculation must be considered because the calculating resolution of the clothoid curve is determined by the tangential velocity and the sampling time. This study proposes a clothoid interpolation based on an iterative true-value prediction. This method can immediately estimate the true value of a clothoid curve by pinching integration and Aitken acceleration even in the case where the calculation resolution is limited. Hence, the method can suppress the discretization error of the clothoid curve. A smooth interpolation for the CNC machines can be achieved using the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
307	Coalition Formation Game Based Access Point Selection for LTE-U and Wi-Fi Coexistence	As a promising solution for the next generation mobile networks (5G) deployment, long term evolution-unlicensed (LTE-U) is expected to improve spectrum utilization and channel capacity, which is beneficial for the industrial Internet of Things integrating many heterogeneous networks. However, such technology migration can potentially induce severe interference to the devices and networks originally operating on unlicensed bands, especially to the Wi-Fi network. In this paper, first of all, we emulate the coexistence of LTE-U networks and Wi-Fi networks, and experimentally evaluate their mutual interference relying on deploying time division duplex based OpenWrt wireless routers. Moreover, an LTE-U and Wi-Fi coexistence mechanism is proposed, where users with diverse traffic demands are capable of accessing either the public LTE-U network or its nearby Wi-Fi network. Finally, an access point selection algorithm with the aid of coalition formation game is developed for improving the system's throughput. Sufficient simulations based on Network Simulator 3 demonstrate that the overall throughput of the LTE-U and Wi-Fi hybrid cosystem outperforms that of the single LTE-U network as well as of the single Wi-Fi network. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
308	Improving the Operation of Solar Water Heating Systems in Green Buildings via Optimized Control Strategies	Solar water heating (SWH) systems are well known and effective structures that transfer solar energy into thermal energy with hot water as the storage. The efficiency of an SWH system is mainly based on well-designed solar collectors and proper operation mechanisms. Although the most existing literature has focused on the efficiency enhancement of solar collectors, limited studies are devoted to improve the operating mechanism. As such, this paper studies the control mechanisms of the SWH system with a purpose so as to help the building manager to achieve targeted energy management goals. In particular, three control approaches are presented for improving the operational efficiency of the SWH system by controlling auxiliary heaters, such as heat pumps, electric heaters, and circulation pumps. The proposed approaches are developed based on different requirements of information such as the hot water demand, weather, and electricity price. Moreover, three various energy management objectives are studied with considering different scenarios in terms of real weather pattern and hot water demand of a commercial building. The results validate that the proposed approaches can improve the operation of the SWH system according to various operation objectives. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25

310	Employing Multi-Objective Search to Enhance Reactive Test Case Generation and Prioritization for Testing Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems	The test case generation and prioritization of industrial cyber-physical systems face critical challenges, and simulation-based testing is one of the most commonly used techniques for testing these complex systems. However, simulation models of industrial CPSs are usually very complex, and executing the simulations becomes computationally expensive, which often make it infeasible to execute all the test cases. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-objective test generation and prioritization approach for testing industrial CPSs by defining a fitness function with four objectives and designing different crossover and mutation operators. We empirically evaluated our fitness function and designed operators along with five multi-objective search algorithms [e.g., nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)] using four case studies. The evaluation results demonstrated that NSGA-II achieved significantly better performance than the other algorithms and managed to improve random search for on average 43.80% for each objective and 49.25% for the quality indicator hypervolume. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
311	Integrity for an event notification within the industrial internet of things by using group signatures	In the last years, several academic research efforts have focused on security requirements, threat models, and attack taxonomies concerning the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in critical systems. Since such systems are strongly data intensive, it is of pivotal importance to provide integrity for the messages moving throughout the IoT infrastructure by means of publish/subscribe services. Integrity provisioning in industrial IoT scenarios has received marginal attention with respect to other primary security features. The existing solutions are lacking the needed focus on the peculiarities of the event notification and on the demand introduced by resource-constrained devices. This work contributes by applying group signatures so as to avoid managing certificates, violating the spatial decoupling, or implying an excessive resource usage. A proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed solution has been realized for platforms based on TinyOS, and simulations with TOSSIM have been conducted in order to empirically assess its performance and effectiveness. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
312	Optimized Cooperative Multiple Access in Industrial Cognitive Networks	We consider optimized cooperation in joint orthogonal multiple access and nonorthogonal multiple access in industrial cognitive networks, in which lots of devices may have to share spectrum and some devices (e.g., those for critical control devices) have higher transmission priority, known as primary users. We consider one secondary transmitter (less important devices) as a potential relay between a primary transmitter and receiver pair. The choice of cooperation scheme differs in terms of use cases. With decode-and-forward relaying, the channel between the primary and secondary users limits the achievable rates especially when it experiences poor channel conditions. To alleviate this problem, we apply analog network coding to directly combine the received primary message for relaying with the secondary message. We find achievable rate regions for these two schemes over Rayleigh fading channels. We then investigate an optimization problem jointly considering orthogonal multiple access and nonorthogonal multiple access, where the secondary rate is maximized under the constraint of maintaining the primary rate. We find both analytical solutions as well as solutions based on experiments through the time sharing strategy between the primary and secondary system and the transmit power allocation strategy at the secondary transmitter. We show the performance improvements of exploiting analog network coding and the impacts of cooperative schemes and user geometry on achievable rates and resource sharing strategies. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

In this paper, we present a general methodology for mobile robot navigation in industrial environments in which the open-loop behavior of the robot and the specifications are based on automata. We build a modular supervisor, which is the conjunction of two supervisors: the first one that enforces the robot to follow the path defined by a planner and the second one that guarantees the satisfaction of the specifications such as prevention of collisions and task and movement management. The proposed navigation architecture allows decentralized implementation, in which the modular supervisor is embedded in the mobile robot, whereas the planner runs in an external agent. Such a feature makes the adaptation of the proposed navigation architecture to different environments easy. The navigation architecture proposed in this paper is illustrated by means of a simulation in a hypothetical environment that resembles a smart factory. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	56

315	Significant Permission Identification for Machine-Learning-Based Android Malware Detection	The alarming growth rate of malicious apps has become a serious issue that sets back the prosperous mobile ecosystem. A recent report indicates that a new malicious app for Android is introduced every 10 s. To combat this serious malware campaign, we need a scalable malware detection approach that can effectively and efficiently identify malware apps. Numerous malware detection tools have been developed, including system-level and network-level approaches. However, scaling the detection for a large bundle of apps remains a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce Significant Permission IDentification (SigPID), a malware detection system based on permission usage analysis to cope with the rapid increase in the number of Android malware. Instead of extracting and analyzing all Android permissions, we develop three levels of pruning by mining the permission data to identify the most significant permissions that can be effective in distinguishing between benign and malicious apps. SigPID then utilizes machine-learning-based classification methods to classify different families of malware and benign apps. Our evaluation finds that only 22 permissions are significant. We then compare the performance of our approach, using only 22 permissions, against a baseline approach that analyzes all permissions. The results indicate that when a support vector machine is used as the classifier, we can achieve over 90% of precision, recall, accuracy, and F-measure, which are about the same as those produced by the baseline approach while incurring the analysis times that are 4-32 times less than those of using all permissions. Compared against other state-of-the-art approaches, SigPID is more effective by detecting 93.62% of malware in the dataset and 91.4% unknown/new malware samples. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	338

317	Secure surveillance framework for IoT systems using probabilistic image encryption	This paper proposes a secure surveillance framework for Internet of things (IoT) systems by intelligent integration of video summarization and image encryption. First, an efficient video summarization method is used to extract the informative frames using the processing capabilities of visual sensors. When an event is detected from keyframes, an alert is sent to the concerned authority autonomously. As the final decision about an event mainly depends on the extracted keyframes, their modification during transmission by attackers can result in severe losses. To tackle this issue, we propose a fast probabilistic and lightweight algorithm for the encryption of keyframes prior to transmission, considering the memory and processing requirements of constrained devices that increase its suitability for IoT systems. Our experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of robustness, execution time, and security compared to other image encryption algorithms. Furthermore, our framework can reduce the bandwidth, storage, transmission cost, and the time required for analysts to browse large volumes of surveillance data and make decisions about abnormal events, such as suspicious activity detection and fire detection in surveillance applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	177
318	Deep Coupling Autoencoder for Fault Diagnosis with Multimodal Sensory Data	Effective fault diagnosis of rotating machinery has multifarious benefits, such as improved safety, enhanced reliability, and reduced maintenance cost, for complex engineered systems. With many kinds of installed sensors for conducting fault diagnosis, one of the key tasks is to develop data fusion strategies that can effectively handle multimodal sensory signals. Most traditional methods use hand-crafted statistical features and then combine these multimodal features simply by concatenating them into a long vector to achieve data fusion. The present study proposes a deep coupling autoencoder (DCAE) model that handles the multimodal sensory signals not residing in a commensurate space, such as vibration and acoustic data, and integrates feature extraction of multimodal data seamlessly into data fusion for fault diagnosis. Specifically, a coupling autoencoder (CAE) is constructed to capture the joint information between different multimodal sensory data, and then a DCAE model is devised for learning the joint feature at a higher level. The CAE is developed by coupling hidden representations of two single-modal autoencoders, which can capture the joint information from multimodal data. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by two experiments, which shows that the DCAE model succeeds in efficiently utilizing multisource sensory data to perform accurate fault diagnosis. Compared with other methods, the proposed method exhibits better performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	150

As prerequisite explicit expressions for the higher order inverse kinematics are presented. Kinematic redundancy is resolved and exploited within the trajectory planning using the joint space decomposition and a novel pseudoinverse-based solution of the higher order inverse kinematics. The approaches are demonstrated for two examples of kinematically redundant manipulators performing time-optimal motions along prescribed end-effector paths in compliance with technological constraints.

Storing all the raw data in the IIoT devices locally is unwise considering that the end devices' energy and storage spaces are strictly limited. In addition, the devices are unreliable and vulnerable to many threats because the networks may be deployed in remote and unattended areas. In this paper, we discuss the emerging challenges in the aspects of data processing, secure data storage, efficient data retrieval and dynamic data collection in IIoT. Then, we design a flexible and economical framework to solve the problems above by integrating the fog computing and cloud computing. Based on the time latency requirements, the collected data are processed and stored by the edge server or the cloud server. Specifically, all the raw data are first preprocessed by the edge server and then the time-sensitive data (e.g., control information) are used and stored locally. The non-time-sensitive data (e.g., monitored data) are transmitted to the cloud server to support data retrieval and mining in the future. A series of experiments and simulation are conducted to evaluate the performance of our scheme.

322	Sustainable Service Allocation Using a Metaheuristic Technique in a Fog Server for Industrial Applications	Reducing energy consumption in the fog computing environment is both a research and an operational challenge for the current research community and industry. There are several industries such as finance industry or healthcare industry that require a rich resource platform to process big data along with edge computing in fog architecture. As a result, sustainable computing in a fog server plays a key role in fog computing hierarchy. The energy consumption in fog servers depends on the allocation techniques of services (user requests) to a set of virtual machines (VMs). This service request allocation in a fog computing environment is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard problem. In this paper, the scheduling of service requests to VMs is presented as a bi-objective minimization problem, where a tradeoff is maintained between the energy consumption and makespan. Specifically, this paper proposes a metaheuristic-based service allocation framework using three metaheuristic techniques, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), binary PSO, and bat algorithm. These proposed techniques allow us to deal with the heterogeneity of resources in the fog computing environment. This paper has validated the performance of these metaheuristic-based service allocation algorithms by conducting a set of rigorous evaluations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	78

324	Investigation of Carrier Demand Response Uncertainty on Energy Flow of Renewable-Based Integrated Electricity-Gas-Heat Systems	Since there are heavy interdependencies among the electrical, heat, and gas systems to supply various load types worldwide, operation of multi-energy carrier (MEC) systems faces critical challenges. Moreover, any uncertainty rising in one carrier would directly influence the energy flow and the secure operation of the whole MEC system. This issue intensifies when an MEC system is integrated with industrial energy carrier demand response (ECDR) consumers and renewable energy sources (RESs). Large industrial ECDR consumers can increase the system uncertainty by randomly participating in the demand response programs and utilizing various carriers. Accordingly, this paper presents a powerful probabilistic tool named 2m + 1 point estimate strategy for energy flow analysis of an integrated MEC system considering ECDR, RES, and various load types uncertainties to control the risks associated with the uncertainties. In addition, a new decomposition technique is presented to accelerate the energy flow solving of the integrated MEC systems. This technique has been promoted by adding a novel noniterative method named holomorphic embedding and the less-computational graph methods for solving the energy flow of the MEC. The proposed probabilistic energy flow is tested on an integrated MEC system employing various incentives for industrial ECDR consumers. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	63

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic compressive wide-band spectrum sensing method based on channel energy reconstruction. After a bank of wide-band random filters is employed to measure the channel energy, rather than to recover all the channel energy in the whole spectrum, only the channel energy with a changing occupancy status in consecutive time slots is recovered. Furthermore, it is unnecessary to use reconstruction algorithm unless there are two or more channels changing their occupancy status. Compared to the existing methods, our proposed schemes bear significant improvements in the probability of detection and reduction of probability of false alarms.

Under this framework, a hierarchical transmission-estimation approach is proposed to improve the transmission reliability and estimation accuracy according to system dynamics. The proposed approach is then optimized by formulating a constrained minimization problem, which is mixed integer nonlinear programming and solved efficiently with a block-coordinate-descent-based decomposition method. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach has superiorities in improving both the estimation accuracy and the energy efficiency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	68
328	Efficient Conversion of Deep Features to Compact Binary Codes Using Fourier Decomposition for Multimedia Big Data	Exponential growth of multimedia data has been witnessed in recent years from various industries, such as e-commerce, health, transportation, and social networks, etc. Access to desired data in such gigantic datasets require sophisticated and efficient retrieval methods. In the last few years, neuronal activations generated by a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) have served as generic descriptors for various tasks including image classification, object detection and segmentation, and image retrieval. They perform incredibly well compared to hand-crafted features. However, these features are usually high dimensional, requiring a lot of memory and computations for indexing and retrieval. For very large datasets, utilization of these high dimensional features in raw form becomes infeasible. In this paper, a highly efficient method is proposed to transform high dimensional deep features into compact binary codes using bidirectional Fourier decomposition. This compact bit code saves memory and eases computations during retrieval. Further, these codes can also serve as hash codes, allowing very efficient access to images in large datasets using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search techniques. Our method does not require any training and achieves considerable retrieval accuracy with short length codes.

329	Co-optimal placement of PMUs and their communication infrastructure for minimization of propagation delay in the WAMS	The phasor measurement unit (PMU) has evolved as an indispensable tool for real-time monitoring and control of the power system, thereby leading to its large-scale deployment in a wide-area measurement system (WAMS). Communication system plays a significant role for transferring measured real-time PMU data to the phasor data concentrator (PDC) for monitoring and control purposes. The propagation delay depends on the spatial position of the PMUs with respect to the PDC and the communication network. This paper deals with the problem of co-optimal placement of PMUs and their communication infrastructure for minimization of propagation delay in a WAMS. The novelty of the work is to explore the feasibility of microwave communication technology as an alternative to the existing fiber-based communication infrastructure in the WAMS. The proposed approach takes the link reliability and the geographical topological variations into consideration for the placement of the microwave links so as to minimize the propagation delay. The merit of the microwave communication technology in the framework of the WAMS is evaluated in terms of its cost and reliability. Simulation results and the propagation delay evaluations for the Eastern power grid of India validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in practical field applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	35
330	An Efficient Indexing Model for the Fog Layer of Industrial Internet of Things	Given the recent proliferation in the number of smart devices connected to the Internet, the era of Internet of Things (IoT) is challenged with massive amounts of data generation. Fog Computing is gaining popularity and is being increasingly deployed in various latency-sensitive application domains including industrial IoT. However, efficient discovery of services is one of the prevailing issues in the fog nodes of industrial IoT, which restrain their efficiencies in availing appropriate services to the clients. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel efficient multilevel index model based on equivalence relation, named the distributed multilevel (DM)-index model, for service maintenance and retrieval in the fog layer of industrial IoT to eliminate redundancy, narrow the search space, reduce both the number of traversed services and retrieval time, ultimately to improve the service discovery efficiency. The efficiency of the proposed index model has been verified theoretically and evaluated experimentally, which demonstrates that the proposed model is effective in achieving much better service discovery and retrieval performance than the sequential and inverted index models. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	36
331	A Lightweight Autoscaling Mechanism for Fog Computing in Industrial Applications	Fog computing provides a more flexible service environment than cloud computing. The lightweight fog environment is suitable for industrial applications. In order to strengthen service scalability, container virtualization has been proposed and studied in recent years. It is vital to explore the tradeoff between service scalability and operating expenses. This paper integrates the hypervisor technique with container virtualization, and constructs an integrated virtualization (IV) fog platform for deploying industrial applications based on the virtual network function. This paper presents a fuzzy-based real-time autoscaling (FRAS) mechanism and implements it in the IV fog platform. The FRAS mechanism provides a dynamic, rapid, lightweight, and low-cost solution to the service autoscaling problem. Experimental results showed that the proposed FRAS mechanism yields a better service scale with lower average delay, error rate, and operating expenses compared to other autoscaling schemes. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	45
332	Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Industrial Cyber-Physical IoT Systems in 5G Era	Cyber-physical Internet of things system (CPIoTS), as an evolution of Internet of things (IoT), plays a significant role in industrial area to support the interoperability and interaction of various machines (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers) by providing seamless connectivity with low bandwidth requirement. The fifth generation (5G) is a key enabling technology to revolutionize the future of industrial CPIoTS. In this paper, a communication framework based on 5G is presented to support the deployment of CPIoTS with a central controller. Based on this framework, multiple sensors and actuators can establish communication links with the central controller in full-duplex mode. To accommodate the signal data in the available channel band, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonconvex programming problem, aiming to maximize the sum energy efficiency of CPIoTS. By introducing the transformation, we decompose the resource allocation problem into power allocation and channel allocation. Moreover, we consider an energy-efficient power allocation algorithm based on game theory and Dinkelbach's algorithm. Finally, to reduce the computational complexity, the channel allocation is modeled as a three-dimensional matching problem, and solved by iterative Hungarian method with virtual devices (IHM-VD). A comparison is performed with well-known existing algorithms to demonstrate the performance of the proposed one. The simulation results validate the efficiency of our proposed model, which significantly outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of meeting the energy efficiency and the QoS requirements. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	97
333	Performance Evaluation and Modeling of an Industrial Application-Layer Firewall	The availability of performance studies and simple models for firewalls able to deal with industrial application-layer communication protocols, such as Modbus/TCP, is crucial when the impact of these devices has to be estimated, even roughly, before their actual deployment in industrial networks. Unfortunately, most manufacturers do not provide this kind of information for commercial off-the-shelf available products. Thus, a viable solution is the development and experimental validation of simple models that can be used by designers to predict those firewall characteristics not explicitly related to their security capabilities. As an example, latency introduced on message forwarding is an aspect of significant interest in many industrial control systems, where delays and jitters in data delivery can severely impact on the effectiveness of the control actions. This paper reports on our experience in developing a performance model for a commercial device able to perform advanced application-layer filtering, in particular of Modbus/TCP traffic. A set of ad hoc designed experiments, performed by means of a purposely developed laboratory testbed, enabled both model development and validation, confirming a good correspondence of the estimated performance with the device actual behavior. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	29
334	Achieving Hybrid Wired/Wireless Industrial Networks with WDetServ: Reliability-Based Scheduling for Delay Guarantees	Industrial control systems are foreseen to operate over hybrid wired/wireless networks. While the controller will be deployed in the wired network, sensors and actuators will be deployed in a wireless sensor network (WSN). To support QoS for control systems, an end-to-end delay bound and a target reliability must be provided in both wireless and wired domains. However, for industrial WSNs, guaranteeing reliability is a challenging task because of low-power communications and the harsh wireless environment. In this work, we present the first QoS framework for arbitrary hybrid wired/wireless networks, which guarantees that the delay bound and the target reliability of each application are provided. As part of this framework, we propose the first reliability-based scheduler for WSN able to achieve a target reliability in the presence of dynamic interference. Simulations of the proposed scheduler prove its suitability in different interference scenarios and motivate further work. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25
335	PPFA: Privacy preserving fog-enabled aggregation in smart grid	For constrained end devices in Internet of Things, such as smart meters (SMs), data transmission is an energy-consuming operation. To address this problem, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving aggregation system with the aid of Fog computing architecture, named PPFA, which enables the intermediate Fog nodes to periodically collect data from nearby SMs and accurately derive aggregate statistics as the fine-grained Fog level aggregation. The Cloud/utility supplier computes overall aggregate statistics by aggregating Fog level aggregation. To minimize the privacy leakage and mitigate the utility loss, we use more efficient and concentrated Gaussian mechanism to distribute noise generation among parties, thus offering provable differential privacy guarantees of the aggregate statistic on both Fog level and Cloud level. In addition, to ensure aggregator obliviousness and system robustness, we put forward a two-layer encryption scheme: the first layer applies OTP to encrypt individual noisy measurement to achieve aggregator obliviousness, while the second layer uses public-key cryptography for authentication purpose. Our scheme is simple, efficient, and practical, it requires only one round of data exchange among a SM, its connected Fog node and the Cloud if there are no node failures, otherwise, one extra round is needed between a meter, its connected Fog node, and the trusted third party. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	143
336	A Heuristic-Based Smart HVAC Energy Management Scheme for University Buildings	Energy management in commercial buildings is a challenging task due to their specific set of requirements. One such building that has not been fully investigated in the literature to provide energy efficiency is a university building. There are many challenges associated while managing the energy of a university building, such as-scheduling of classes, availability of faculty, and capacity of classrooms. To address these challenges for providing better energy efficiency, an efficient heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) management scheme for a university building is presented in this paper. The HVAC loads are chosen as these are more flexible in the classrooms than other loads, such as-lighting and projectors. In this paper, the HVAC energy management problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. To solve this problem, a heuristic-based algorithm is proposed, which optimally minimizes the use of HVAC without affecting user comfort. Moreover, it also minimizes the cost of rescheduling the classes on a given day. The results obtained on the dataset traces taken from a university building clearly indicate that the proposed scheme reduces the energy demand of HVAC systems by 19.75% for an entire week without affecting the user comfort. Moreover, this scheme shows superior performance when compared with existing commercial demand response management schemes with respect to load reduction and cost savings. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	33
337	Restoring Aspect Ratio Distortion of Natural Images with Convolutional Neural Network	We propose a method to restore aspect ratio distortion of images using convolutional neural network (CNN). The 'aspect ratio,' which is focused on this research, means degree of horizontal stretching of images. Indeed an image can be distorted by vertical or horizontal stretching, which does not maintain the aspect ratio. In the proposed method, we construct an aspect ratio estimator whose input is a (possibly distorted) image and output is a scalar value of aspect ratio. Since estimation of aspect ratio from image can be regarded as regression problem, we modeled the estimator by CNN. Once we have a reliable estimate of aspect ratio of an image, the restoration can be done straightforwardly by inverse stretching. In the experiments, we evaluated performance of the model trained on Pascal VOC natural image dataset. Our method can precisely restore the distortion within $1.4\%$ of stretch from original images on average, which outperforms average human performance (i.e., about $13\%$). In terms of accuracy, $99.86\%$ of distorted images are successfully restored. We also propose training methods to enhance the robustness of the CNN against particular types of disturbance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
338	Performance Analysis of CSMA/CA and PCA for Time Critical Industrial IoT Applications	Recently proposed IEEE 802.15.4-2015 MAC introduced a new prioritized contention access (PCA) for transfer of time-critical packets with lower channel access latency compared to carrier sense multiple access - collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). In this paper, we first propose a novel Markov-chain-based analytical model for unslotted CSMA/CA and PCA for industrial applications. The unslotted model is further extended to derive the analytical model for slotted CSMA/CA and PCA. Primary emphasis is laid on understanding the performance of PCA compared to CSMA/CA for different traffic classes in industrial applications. The performance analysis shows that the slotted PCA achieves a reduction of 63.3% and 97% in delay and power consumption respectively compared to slotted CSMA/CA, whereas unslotted PCA achieves a delay reduction of 53.3% and reduction of power consumption by 96% compared to unslotted CSMA/CA without any significant loss of reliability. The proposed analytical models for both slotted and unslotted IEEE 802.15.4-2015 MAC offer satisfactory performance with less than 5% error when validated using Monte Carlo simulations. Also, the performance is verified using real-time testbed. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
339	Space-Reserved Cooperative Caching in 5G Heterogeneous Networks for Industrial IoT	The large amount of data among billions of devices deployed for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) cause a massive energy consumption. Driven by the pursuit of green communication, this paper presents a space-reserved cooperative caching scheme for IIoT in the fifth generation mobile heterogeneous networks, where the cache space in a base station is divided into two parts, one is used to store the prefetched data from the servers ahead of the device request time and the other is reserved to store the temporarily buffering data in the wireless transmission queue at the device request time. With the constraint that the quality of service is guaranteed, we propose an algorithm to obtain the optimal proportion between the two parts of the cache space for the purpose of reducing the average energy consumption. Simulation results verified that the proposed caching scheme is more efficient than the conventional one with respect to the average energy consumption. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	58
340	A Cross Iteration Estimator with Base Vector for Estimation of Electric Mining Haul Truck's Mass and Road Grade	Vehicle mass and road grade are important to traction control and safety control of electric mining haul trucks (EMHTs), especially to autonomous EMHTs. This paper proposes a base-vector based cross iteration estimator (BVCIE) to simultaneously estimate the vehicle mass and the road grade for EMHTs. To develop the estimator, the dynamics model for EMHTs is first built and the unknown parameters are identified by the recursive least square. Then the estimator is proposed by selecting a base vector from the parameters to be estimated, and by using a cross iteration strategy to update older information. This estimator is based on the ideology that the total mass of EMHT is a constant in every travelling trip. The estimator is finally validated on different loads under different road conditions with 930E. The experimental results show that both the vehicle mass and the road grade can be estimated with good accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15
341	Optimal Demand Response Scheduling for Water Distribution Systems	As energy intensive infrastructures, water distribution systems (WDSs) are promising candidates for providing demand response (DR) and frequency regulation services in power systems operation. However, models that tap the full flexibility of WDSs to provide the services while respecting the operational constraints of water networks are remained scarce. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for optimizing the participation of water distribution system operators (W-DSOs) in DR and frequency regulation markets, which captures the joint flexibility of variable frequency pumps and water tanks and takes into account the underlying hydraulic operating constraints of WDSs. The proposed framework consists of two optimization models, where the first-step model optimizes the operation of water pumps and tanks for minimizing the W-DSO's water procurement cost, and the second-step model optimizes the DR and frequency regulation up and down offers by modifying the operation of water pumps and tanks, such that the W-DSO's profit of providing the services is maximized. The proposed model ensures the availability of services by taking into account the interdependence and compatibility of the DR load reduction and load recovery and the frequency regulation up and down services. In addition, the proposed models incorporate a detailed formulation of water distribution networks and the associated hydraulic constraints, ensuring deliverability of the services to power systems. The nonlinear terms appearing in the WDS constraints are linearized to convert the proposed models to instances of mixed-integer linear programming problems. The proposed model is implemented on a 15-node WDS, using the energy and ancillary service prices of the California ISO. The results reflect significant profit opportunities for the W-DSO by providing DR and frequency regulation services in the markets. © 2017 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	45
342	Thermal pattern contrast diagnostic of microcracks with induction thermography for aircraft braking components	Reciprocating impact load leads to plastic deformation on the surface of the kinematic chains in an aircraft brake system. As a result, this causes fatigue and various complex natural damages. Due to the complex surface conditions and the coexistence damages, it is extremely difficult to diagnose microcracks by using conventional thermography inspection methods. In this paper, the thermal pattern contrast method is proposed for weak thermal signal detection using eddy current pulsed thermography. In this process, the extraction and subsequent separation differentiate a maximum of the thermal spatial-transient pattern between defect and nondefect areas. Specifically, a successive optical flow is established to conduct a projection of the thermal diffusion. This directly gains the benefits of capturing the thermal propagation characteristics. It enables us to build the motion context connected between the local and the global thermal spatial pattern. Principal component analysis is constructed to further mine the spatial-transient patterns to enhance the detectability and sensitivity in microcrack detection. Finally, experimental studies have been conducted on an artificial crack in a steel sample and on natural fatigue cracks in aircraft brake components in order to validate the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42

In this paper, we investigate how to apply IIoUAVs for power line inspection in smart grid from an energy-efficiency perspective. First, the energy consumption minimization problem is formulated as a joint optimization problem, which involves both the large-timescale optimization, such as trajectory scheduling, velocity control, and frequency regulation, and the small-timescale optimization, such as relay selection and power allocation. Then, the original NP-hard problem is transformed into a two-stage suboptimal problem by exploring the timescale difference and the energy magnitude difference between the large-timescale and the small-timescale optimizations, and is solved by combining dynamic programming (DP), auction theory, and matching theory. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified based on real-world map and realistic power grid topology. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	94
344	Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation in the Energy-Harvesting-Aided D2D Communication	Device-to-device (D2D)-enabled Internet-of-things promises higher spectral efficiency and system capacity by sharing the cellular spectrum and offloading the cellular traffic. However, it poses new challenges in terms of resource allocation because of interference from D2D to base station and vice versa in the downlink. Moreover, energy efficient operation of the network becomes a major challenge because of unattended operation of devices. In this study, we investigate resource allocation for the energy-harvesting-aided D2D communication underlaying cellular network. We formulate a joint subcarrier assignment and power allocation problem for multiple cellular and energy harvesting direct D2D links to maximize the overall sum rate subject to quality of service, subcarrier reuse, power, and energy harvesting constraints. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming and is difficult to be solved in polynomial time. Therefore, a low complexity algorithm named energy harvesting and gain-based resource allocation (EHGRA) is proposed, which determines reuse partners considering interference among D2D and cellular links, and then, allocates power optimally to them such that the sum rate is maximized. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that energy harvesting can boost up the system performance and at the same time can achieve higher sum rate over short frame duration. Comparison shows that EHGRA performs better than the existing algorithms in terms of overall sum rate. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	62

346	MAC Protocols for Wake-Up Radio: Principles, Modeling and Performance Analysis	In wake-up radio (WuR) enabled wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a node triggers a data communication at any time instant by sending a wake-up call (WuC) in an on-demand manner. Such wake-up operations eliminate idle listening and overhearing burden for energy consumption in duty-cycled WSNs. Although WuR exhibits its superiority for light traffic, it is inefficient to handle high traffic load in a network. This paper makes an effort towards improving the performance of WuR under diverse load conditions with a twofold contribution. We first propose three protocols that support variable traffic loads by enabling respectively clear channel assessment (CCA), backoff plus CCA, and adaptive WuC transmissions. These protocols provide various options for achieving reliable data transmission, low latency, and energy efficiency for ultralow power consumption applications. Then, we develop an analytical framework based on an M/G/1/2 queue to evaluate the performance of these WuR protocols.

In scope of CPPS, current approaches to reduce the engineering effort focus on manufacturing technology. There are initial approaches in the domain of process engineering available.

For this purpose, a declarative recipe description is combined with an ontological model. This enables an automatic inference of technical requirements.

However, plenty of studies providing different formulations for ITS depend on Master Control Center and require a high level of hardware configuration. The systematized technologies for distributed architectures are still not explored in detail. In this paper, we proposed a novel distributed cyber-physical system for connected and automated vehicles, and related methodologies are illustrated. Every vehicle in this system is modeled as a double-integrator and supposed to travel along a desired trajectory for maintaining a rigid formation geometry. The desired trajectory is generated by reference leading vehicles using information from multiple sources, while ordinary following vehicles use velocity and position information from their nearest neighbors and sensor information from on-board sensors to correct their own performance. Information graphs are used to illustrate the interaction topology between connected and automated vehicles. Edge computing technology is used to analyze and process information, such that the risk of privacy leaks can be greatly reduced. The performance scaling laws for the network with a one-dimensional information graph are generalized to networks with D -dimensional information graphs, and the results of the experiments show that the performance of the connected and automated vehicles matches very well with analytic predictions.

This study combines a battery bank and a supercapacitor bank to achieve high performance energy sources for electric scooters. The proposed system can be employed on commercial 48-V electric scooters for evaluation. The presented approach follows the WPT frequency standard of SAE J2954 to build the energy transmission. Based on the control of the state of charge on the battery bank, this paper proposes a three-mode strategy for hybrid energy management. The proposed HESS makes three compact and integrated contributions. First, it acts as the regulator to manage the input energy from WPT. Second, it manipulates the energy distributions to the battery and supercapacitor. Third, it provides a mechanism to initiate a short period of 'negative current' to avoid excessive exploitation of the battery and facilitates palliation upon polarization. This function has the ability to extend battery life. The system performance of the electric scooter, as a result, can be improved.

Several IIoT applications such as the ones related to healthcare systems are expected to widely utilize the evolving 5G technology. This 5G-inspired IIoT paradigm in healthcare applications enables the users to interact with various types of sensors via secure wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs). Users of 5G networks should interact with each other in a seamless secure manner. And thus, security richness is highly coveted for the real time wireless sensor network systems. Asking users to verify themselves before every interaction is a tedious, time-consuming process that disrupts inhabitants' activities, and degrades the overall healthcare system performance. To avoid such problems, we propose a context-sensitive seamless identity provisioning (CSIP) framework for the IIoT. CSIP proposes a secure mutual authentication approach using hash and global assertion value to prove that the proposed mechanism can achieve the major security goals of the WMSN in a short time period. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	176
355	A friction model-based frequency response analysis for frictional servo systems	This paper presents a friction model-based frequency response analysis (FRA) method, which gives a precise linear mechanical dynamics model to design effective controllers and analyze accurate control characteristics for frictional servo systems. As well known, frequency-domain identification approaches using a sine sweep are widely used to obtain linear dynamics. However, nonlinear friction in the mechanism varies the apparent frequency-domain characteristic of the linear dynamics due to the nonlinearity. The proposed FRA estimates effective excitation thrust for actual linear dynamics in the sine sweep movement, by means of a friction model as well as a phase delay model. Theoretical analyses show that the proposed FRA can identify the correct linear dynamics, preventing influence of nonlinear friction as well as phase delay properties included in a plant system. The effectiveness of the proposed FRA is verified through theoretical analyses and experiments both in frequency and time domains, in comparison to two conventional FRA methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
356	A Practical Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (3PDA) Scheme for Smart Grid	The real-time electricity consumption data can be used in value-added service such as big data analysis, meanwhile the single user's privacy needs to be protected. How to balance the data utility and the privacy preservation is a vital issue, where the privacy-preserving data aggregation could be a feasible solution. Most of the existing data aggregation schemes rely on a trusted third party (TTP). However, this assumption will have negative impact on reliability, because the system can be easily knocked down by the denial of service attack. In this paper, a practical privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme is proposed without TTP, in which the users with some extent trust construct a virtual aggregation area to mask the single user's data, and meanwhile, the aggregation result almost has no effect for the data utility in large scale applications. The computation cost and communication overhead are reduced in order to promote the practicability. Moreover, the security analysis and the performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme is robust and efficient. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	140

Hence, deep stacked autoencoder (SAE) is introduced for soft sensor in this paper. As for output prediction purpose, traditional deep learning algorithms cannot extract high-level output-related features. Thus, a novel variable-wise weighted stacked autoencoder (VW-SAE) is proposed for hierarchical output-related feature representation layer by layer. By correlation analysis with the output variable, important variables are identified from other ones in the input layer of each autoencoder. The variables are assigned with different weights accordingly. Then, variable-wise weighted autoencoders are designed and stacked to form deep networks. An industrial application shows that the proposed VW-SAE can give better prediction performance than the traditional multilayer neural networks and SAE. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	352

359	An Efficient Deep Learning Model to Predict Cloud Workload for Industry Informatics	Deep learning, as the most important architecture of current computational intelligence, achieves super performance to predict the cloud workload for industry informatics. However, it is a nontrivial task to train a deep learning model efficiently since the deep learning model often includes a great number of parameters. In this paper, an efficient deep learning model based on the canonical polyadic decomposition is proposed to predict the cloud workload for industry informatics. In the proposed model, the parameters are compressed significantly by converting the weight matrices to the canonical polyadic format. Furthermore, an efficient learning algorithm is designed to train the parameters. Finally, the proposed efficient deep learning model is applied to the workload prediction of virtual machines on cloud. Experiments are conducted on the datasets collected from PlanetLab to validate the performance of the proposed model by comparing with other machine-learning-based approaches for workload prediction of virtual machines. Results indicate that the proposed model achieves a higher training efficiency and workload prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art machine-learning-based approaches, proving the potential of the proposed model to provide predictive services for industry informatics. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	136
360	Video Image Defogging Recognition Based on Recurrent Neural Network	Fog and haze make the image degraded, and seriously affect the normal operation of the information system in the fields of military, transportation, and safety monitoring, under this condition, the image defogging is of great significance. In order to meet the needs of real-time processing of existing video's defogging process, a recognition algorithm based on recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper. At present, the mainstream image defogging algorithm mainly uses a variety of fog related color features, however, different color prior knowledge often has its own scene limitation. We use sparse automatic coding machine to extract the texture features of the image, and extract all kinds of fog related color features. Then, we use the recurrent neural network to implement sample training process, and we obtain the mapping relationship between texture structure features and color features and scene depth, and then we estimate the scene deep map of fog images. Finally, the atmospheric scattering model is used to recover the fog-free image according to the scene deep map. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can effectively obtain the scene depth of the image, and recover the ideal fog-free image. Robustness has been tested and guaranteed through the numerical simulation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
361	Answering Multiattribute Top-k Queries in Fog-Supported Wireless Sensor Networks Leveraging Priority Assignment Technology	The large-scale and distributed characteristic of multiattribute sensors requires the fog computing paradigm to support location-awareness and latency-sensitive monitoring and query in industrial applications. In these settings, supporting the preference top-k query processing in skewness distribution is a challenge. In this paper, we propose to mitigate the problem of processing a large number of continuous multiattribute (i.e., multidimensional) top-k queries, each with its specific preference, in fog-supported wireless sensor networks. Specifically, a priority-aware index tree is constructed to support the efficient filtering through querying branch nodes according to their top-k result generation probabilities. We have also considered three situations to generate the filter thresholds for the preference user queries. To further eliminate the transmission of invalid thresholds and query results, an enhanced top-k query processing mechanism based on dual transform and K-skyband is developed. Experiments using synthetic dataset and Intel Berkeley Lab dataset show that our proposed approach can have significant improvements in energy efficiency over other reactive methods. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3

363	A novel Latin-square-based secret sharing for M2M communications	Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, an automated communications technology for the equipment or devices, holds great promise in every corner of the modern society, such as civil transportation, smart homes, smart grids, and industrial automation. The M2M technology is still in its infancy, and further development and deployment of M2M systems hinges on establishing an efficient and secure information management system with a satisfactory security level. In this paper, we extend the idea of (t,n) secret sharing for information transmission in M2M with high security and efficiency. Specifically, a secret is divided into 2k shares, and then, transmitted through 2k node-disjoint paths constructed by the Latin square. Note that in our scheme, the secret key is simultaneously transmitted along with the encrypted message through these 2k paths from the source node to the destination node, which greatly improves the efficiency of point-to-point communications in M2M systems. Furthermore, owing to the properties of (t,n) secret sharing, the security of M2M communications is guaranteed. In addition, to avoid dishonest participants, verifiable secret sharing is supported in the proposed scheme. Sufficient theoretical proof and performance analysis demonstrate that our scheme is secure and efficient for M2M communications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	17

365	Data-Driven Coherency Identification for Generators Based on Spectral Clustering	The wide-area measurement system provides a new data acquisition and supervisory control tool for a power system, and the data acquisition level is increased dramatically with its development in the smart grid environment. Huge data associated with the power system operation are acquired, which are beneficial for enhancing situational awareness of a power system concerned. Identifying the coherency among synchronous generators using real-time signals from phasor measurement units (PMUs) is one of the major tasks of situational awareness in power system operation. Given this background, a data-driven coherency identification methodology is proposed based on the spectral clustering algorithm. First, several trajectory dissimilarity indices for the rotor angle and rotor speed trajectories of generators as measured by PMUs are presented based on the trajectory similarity theory. Second, a decision-making method based on the Gini coefficient and Kendall rank correlation coefficient is presented for integrating multiple indices describing trajectory dissimilarities. Third, the spectral clustering algorithm is presented to identify the coherency of synchronous generators, and silhouette is presented for determining a reasonable number of coherent groups. Finally, oscillation events happened/simulated in two actual power systems, i.e., Guangdong power system in China and Western Interconnection power system in North America, are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven coherency identification methodology. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	67
366	Evaluating Electric Vehicles' Response Time to Regulation Signals in Smart Grids	Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered as a flexible load in smart grids. This flexibility promotes the EVs to be good candidates for providing the grid with ancillary services, such as regulation services. A group of EVs controlled by an aggregator can collectively work as a regulation reserve in the electric grid. However, a fast response to the regulation commands is crucial to providing reliable regulation service. Typically, the response time to the regulation command requires to be less than four seconds. In this paper, we precisely evaluate the expected time delay from the instant when an aggregator server sends a regulation command to n EVs to the instant when all the EVs' responses are received successfully by the server. To achieve this goal, first, a realistic communication structure between the aggregator server and the EVs is considered. Second, the wireless link between the access point (AP) and the EVs is accurately modeled in order to estimate the average delay. The model is based on Markov chain representation for the wireless IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. Two important factors are considered in this model. First, the packet loss probability due to the lossy wireless environment has been incorporated into the model. Second, the transition stages for the contention window size of 802.11 MAC protocol to reach the saturation stage is taken into account. The model has been validated by means of extensive simulation using the well-known Network Simulator 2 (NS2) tool. Our analysis shows that one AP is capable of handling up to 1000 EVs without violating the 4-s latency limit when the probability of packet loss is 0.01. However, this number decreases significantly, less than 500 EVs, when the wireless link is experiencing a significant packet loss probability of 0.2. Further, we show that by commanding a subgroup of the charging EVs, it is possible to achieve the same regulation service but with a lesser response time, compared to commanding all charging EVs every time. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
367	Server-aided attribute-based signature with revocation for resource-constrained industrial-internet-of-things devices	The industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT) can be seen as the usage of Internet-of-things technologies in industries, which provides a way to improve the operational efficiency. An attribute-based signature (ABS) has been a very useful technique for services requiring anonymous authentication in practice, where a signer can sign a message over a set of attributes without disclosing any information about his/her identity, and a signature only attests to the fact that it is created by a signer with several attributes satisfying some claim predicate. However, an ABS scheme requires exponentiation and/or pairing operations in the signature generation and verification algorithms, and hence, it is quite expensive for resource-constrained devices like a sensor in the IIoT network to run an ABS scheme. To reduce the computational overheads for both signers and verifiers, it has been suggested to introduce a server to help with signature generation and verification, but existing results on the ABS with 'server-aided computation' either suffer from the security issues or are not sufficiently efficient. In this paper, we consider server-aided ABS one step further, and propose a notion called server-aided ABS with revocation (SA-ABSR), which not only securely mitigates the workloads of users in generating and verifying signatures, but also enables user revocation by having the server immediately stop signature generations for revoked signers. We formally define the security model for SA-ABSR, present a concrete construction of SA-ABSR based on a standard ABS scheme, and prove its security under the defined security model. Also, we implement the proposed SA-ABSR scheme and the underlying standard ABS scheme to evaluate the performance, from which it is easy to see that the proposed SA-ABSR scheme is more efficient than its underlying ABS scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	39
368	Stochastic Model Predictive Control of Air Conditioning System for Electric Vehicles: Sensitivity Study, Comparison, and Improvement	A stochastic model predictive controller (SMPC) of air conditioning (AC) system is proposed to improve the energy efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs). A Markov-chain based velocity predictor is adopted to provide a sense of the future disturbances over the SMPC control horizon. The sensitivity of electrified AC plant to solar radiation, ambient temperature, and relative air flow speed is quantificationally analyzed from an energy efficiency perspective. Three control approaches are compared in terms of the electricity consumption, cabin temperature, and comfort fluctuation, which include the proposed SMPC method, a generally used bang-bang controller, and dynamic programming as the benchmark. Real solar radiation and ambient temperature data are measured to validate the effectiveness of the SMPC. Comparison results illustrate that SMPC is able to improve the AC energy economy by 12% compared to the rule-based controller. The cabin temperature variation is reduced by more than 50.4%, resulting with a much better cabin comfort. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
369	GMM and CNN Hybrid Method for Short Utterance Speaker Recognition	During the last few years, the speaker recognition technique has been widely attractive for its extensive application in many fields, such as speech communications, domestics services, and smart terminals. As a critical method, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) makes it possible to achieve the recognition capability that is close to the hearing ability of human in a long speech. However, the GMM is failing to recognize a short utterance speaker with a high accuracy. Aiming at solving this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel model to enhance the recognition accuracy of the short utterance speaker recognition system. Different from traditional models based on the GMM, we design a method to train a convolutional neural network to process spectrograms, which can describe speakers better. Thus, the recognition system gains the considerable accuracy as well as the reasonable convergence speed. The experiment results show that our model can help to decrease the equal error rate of the recognition from 4.9% to 2.5%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	93
370	Quantifying the potential economic benefits of flexible industrial demand in the european power system	The envisaged decarbonization of the European power system introduces complex techno-economic challenges to its operation and development. Demand flexibility can significantly contribute in addressing these challenges and enable a cost-effective transition to the low-carbon future. Although extensive previous work has analyzed the impacts of residential and commercial demand flexibility, the respective potential of the industrial sector has not yet been thoroughly investigated despite its large size. This paper presents a novel, whole-system modeling framework to comprehensively quantify the potential economic benefits of flexible industrial demand (FID) for the European power system. This framework considers generation, transmission, and distribution sectors of the system, and determines the least-cost long-Term investment and short-Term operation decisions. FID is represented through a generic, process-Agnostic model, which, however, accounts for fixed energy requirements and load recovery effects associated with industrial processes. The numerical studies demonstrate multiple significant value streams of FID in Europe, including capital cost savings by avoiding investments in additional generation and transmission capacity and distribution reinforcements, as well as operating cost savings by enabling higher utilization of renewable generation sources and providing balancing services. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
371	Simultaneous Trajectory Planning and Tracking Using an MPC Method for Cyber-Physical Systems: A Case Study of Obstacle Avoidance for an Intelligent Vehicle	As a typical example of cyber-physical systems, intelligent vehicles are receiving increasing attention, and the obstacle avoidance problem for such vehicles has become a hot topic of discussion. This paper presents a simultaneous trajectory planning and tracking controller for use under cruise conditions based on a model predictive control (MPC) approach to address obstacle avoidance for an intelligent vehicle. The reference trajectory is parameterized as a cubic function in time and is determined by the lateral position and velocity of the intelligent vehicle and the velocity and yaw angle of the obstacle vehicle at the start point of the lane change maneuver. Then, the control sequence for the vehicle is incorporated into the expression for the reference trajectory that is used in the MPC optimization problem by treating the lateral velocity of the intelligent vehicle at the end point of the lane change as an intermediate variable. In this way, trajectory planning and tracking are both captured in a single MPC optimization problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed simultaneous trajectory planning and tracking approach, joint veDYNA-Simulink simulations were conducted in the unconstrained and constrained cases under leftward and rightward lane change conditions. The results illustrate that the proposed MPC-based simultaneous trajectory planning and tracking approach achieves acceptable obstacle avoidance performance for an intelligent vehicle. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	118

With the popularity of cloud computing, it provides users with the convenience of outsourcing calculations while bringing the risk of privacy disclosure. Aiming at the problem above, from the characteristics of the secure cloud service system, this paper proposes a secure high-order clustering algorithm by fast search and find of density peaks on hybrid cloud. In the proposed scheme, the client first builds the encrypted object tensors with user data using homomorphic encryption, then uploads them to the cloud to completely implement the proposed protocols. In the end, clustering results perturbed with random numbers are returned to client for remove perturbation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a smart grid dataset in terms of clustering accuracy, efficiency, and speedup ratio. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can accurately and effectively cluster big data without disclosing user privacy while ensuring that the client is very lightweight. Therefore, the proposed scheme with high security and scalability is suitable for clustering industrial Internet-of-Things big data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25

375	Thermography-based methodology for multifault diagnosis on kinematic chain	The procedures for condition monitoring of electromechanical systems are undergoing a reformulation, mainly, due to the current thermographic affordability of infrared cameras to be incorporated in industrial applications. However, high-performing multifault data-driven methodologies must be investigated in order to infer reliable condition information from the thermal distribution of not only electrical motors but also of shafts and couplings. To address this issue, a novel thermography-based methodology is proposed. First, the infrared capture is processed to obtain a thermographic residual image of the kinematic chain. Second, the thermal distribution of the image's regions of interest is characterized by means of statistical features. Finally, a distributed self-organizing map structure is used to model the nominal thermal distribution to subsequently perform a fault detection and identification. The method provides a reliability quantification of the resulting condition assessment in order to avoid misclassifications and identify the actual fault root-causes. The performance and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated experimentally and compared with the classical maximum temperature gradient procedure. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11

The LTE fulfills the resource demands of the next generation applications for now. We identify security issues in authentication mechanism used in LTE that without countermeasures might give super user rights to unauthorized users. The LTE uses static LTE key to derive the entire key hierarchy, i.e., LTE follows Evolved Packet System-Authentication and Key Agreement based authentication, which discloses user identity, location, and other personally identifiable information. To counter this, we propose a public key cryptosystem named 'International mobile subscriber identity Protected Console Grid based Authentication and Key Agreement (IPG-AKA) protocol' to address the vulnerabilities related to weak key management. From the data obtained from threat modeling and simulation results, we claim that the IPG-AKA scheme not only improves security of authentication procedures, but also shows improvements in authentication loads and reduction in key generation time.

377	Sparse principal component thermography for subsurface defect detection in composite products	Active thermography is an efficient and powerful technique for nondestructive testing of products made of composite materials, which enables rapid inspection of large areas, presents results as easily interpreted high-resolution images, and is easy to operate. In recent years, a number of thermographic data analysis methods were developed to enhance the visibility of subsurface defects, among which principal component thermography (PCT) is recommended because of its capability to enhance the contrast between defective and defect-free areas, compress data, and reduce noise. In this study, a sparse principal component thermography (SPCT) method is proposed, which inherits the advantages of PCT and allows more flexibility by introducing a penalization term. Compared to PCT, SPCT provides more interpretable analysis results owing to its structure sparsity.

However, PCC method could be improved by considering two points. First, the current reference used in the cost function of PCC control scheme is usually produced by a proportional and integration speed controller. Confront with load torque and time-varying system parameters, it is a better solution to design a disturbance estimation based feed-forward compensated controller. In this way, the current reference could be generated faster and more accurate. Second, the PCC method is model-based method which means the accuracy of the model parameters are essential. In real system, time-varying parameters existed almost always.

380	Sparse Deep Stacking Network for Fault Diagnosis of Motor	A sparse deep learning method is proposed to overcome overfitting risk of deep networks with a large number of nodes and layers. Deep stacking network (DSN) is a classic and effective deep learning method, and its sparse form is presented to generate the sparse deep learning method. In DSN, output labels are encoded as a series consisted of 1 and 0. This coding strategy makes output labels to be sparse. However, sparsity of output labels is not considered in DSN model. Considering this limitation, sparse DSN (SDSN) is developed in this paper. The SDSN extends tradition DSN in sparsity characterization using a sparse regularization term. By this term, predicted output label is constrained to be similar with ideal output label that is binary and consisted of continuous 1 and 0 with a sidestep shape. The sparse regularization term is used as a soft threshold strategy to set irrelevant element to be zero, by which effectiveness of SDSN is enhanced. Case studies about fault diagnosis of motor are used to validate performance of SDSN. Comparison between SDSN and commonly used deep networks is further conducted. The results show advance of SDSN for fault classification. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	120

383	Cross-Project Transfer Representation Learning for Vulnerable Function Discovery	Machine learning is now widely used to detect security vulnerabilities in the software, even before the software is released. But its potential is often severely compromised at the early stage of a software project when we face a shortage of high-quality training data and have to rely on overly generic hand-crafted features. This paper addresses this cold-start problem of machine learning, by learning rich features that generalize across similar projects. To reach an optimal balance between feature-richness and generalizability, we devise a data-driven method including the following innovative ideas. First, the code semantics are revealed through serialized abstract syntax trees (ASTs), with tokens encoded by Continuous Bag-of-Words neural embeddings. Next, the serialized ASTs are fed to a sequential deep learning classifier (Bi-LSTM) to obtain a representation indicative of software vulnerability. Finally, the neural representation obtained from existing software projects is then transferred to the new project to enable early vulnerability detection even with a small set of training labels. To validate this vulnerability detection approach, we manually labeled 457 vulnerable functions and collected 30 000+ nonvulnerable functions from six open-source projects. The empirical results confirmed that the trained model is capable of generating representations that are indicative of program vulnerability and is adaptable across multiple projects. Compared with the traditional code metrics, our transfer-learned representations are more effective for predicting vulnerable functions, both within a project and across multiple projects. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	93

386	A resilient architecture for the smart grid	The smart grid offers many benefits due to the bidirectional communication between the users and the utility company, which makes it possible to perform a fine-grain consumption metering. This can be used for demand response purposes with the generation and delivery of electricity in real time. It is essential to rapidly anticipate high peaks of demand or potential attacks, so as to avoid power outages and denial of service, while effectively supplying consumption areas. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture where cloud computing resources are leveraged (and tested in practice) to enable, on the one hand, the consumption prediction through time-series forecasting, as well as load balancing to uniformly distribute the demand over a set of available generators. On the other hand, it also allows the detection of connectivity losses and intrusions within the control network by using controllability concepts. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	32
387	Online False Data Injection Attack Detection with Wavelet Transform and Deep Neural Networks	State estimation is critical to the operation and control of modern power systems. However, many cyber-attacks, such as false data injection attacks, can circumvent conventional detection methods and interfere the normal operation of grids. While there exists research focusing on detecting such attacks in dc state estimation, attack detection in ac systems is also critical, since ac state estimation is more widely employed in power utilities. In this paper, we propose a new false data injection attack detection mechanism for ac state estimation. When malicious data are injected in the state vectors, their spatial and temporal data correlations may deviate from those in normal operating conditions. The proposed mechanism can effectively capture such inconsistency by analyzing temporally consecutive estimated system states using wavelet transform and deep neural network techniques. We assess the performance of the proposed mechanism with comprehensive case studies on IEEE 118-and 300-bus power systems. The results indicate that the mechanism can achieve a satisfactory attack detection accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary sensitivity test on the control parameters of the proposed mechanism. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	151
388	A learning framework of adaptive manipulative skills from human to robot	Robots are often required to generalize the skills learned from human demonstrations to fulfil new task requirements. However, skill generalization will be difficult to realize when facing with the following situations: the skill for a complex multistep task includes a number of features; some special constraints are imposed on the robots during the process of task reproduction; and a completely new situation quite different with the one in which demonstrations are given to the robot. This work proposes a new framework to facilitate robot skill generalization. The basic idea lies in that the learned skills are first segmented into a sequence of subskills automatically, then each individual subskill is encoded and regulated accordingly. Specifically, we adapt each set of the segmented movement trajectories individually instead of the whole movement profiles, thus, making it more convenient for the realization of skill generalization. In addition, human limb stiffness estimated from surface electromyographic signals is considered in the framework for the realization of human-to-robot variable impedance control skill transfer, as well as the generalization of both movement trajectories and stiffness profiles. Experimental study has been performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	100
389	Decentralized Real-Time Energy Management for a Reconfigurable Multiple-Source Energy System	This paper discusses decentralized real-time energy management for multiple-source hybrid energy systems (HESs), which adapts to the sudden change in system configuration, such as due to failure of certain devices. An engine-generator/battery/ultracapacitor (UC) HES is chosen as a case study facilitating the following theoretical discussion. The energy management problem is first modeled as a noncooperative game, in which the different preferences of the energy sources (engine-generator, battery pack, and UC pack) in actual operation are quantified through their individual utility functions. The Nash equilibrium is iteratively reached at each control instant via a learning algorithm. Under the game theory based control, each source or player tends to maximize its own preference. However, its satisfaction level also depends on decisions of others. This real-time interaction in decision making provides the proposed energy management a capability to autonomously adapt to the reconfigured HES. A tuning procedure of weight coefficients in the utility functions also helps to further improve the adaptiveness of the decentralized energy management. Both the simulation and real-time implementation show that the game theory based energy management strategy has a comparable performance to the classical centralized benchmarking strategy. Meanwhile, the decentralized strategy demonstrates an obvious flexibility handling the cases when the configuration of the HES varies both statically and dynamically. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
390	Host-Target Vehicle Model-Based Lateral State Estimation for Preceding Target Vehicles Considering Measurement Delay	Automated vehicle control requires full knowledge of motion behavior of the preceding target vehicles (PTVs), and the states such as longitudinal/lateral velocity and yaw rate are critical for the PTV behavior description. However, the PTV's lateral states estimation have seldom been addressed in the state-of-the-art literatures. Aimed at providing reliable PTV lateral states, this paper presents a novel combined model-based estimation scheme. Different from the conventional PTV models, the proposed model is constructed based on the host-target vehicle dynamics and road constraints. Specifically, steering angle of the PTV is included in the state vector. The measurements, such as heading angle, road curvature, and lateral distance to the lane center, are available from an onboard vision system. As a vision system inevitably has measurement delay, a modified Kalman filter is developed to address the sampling issue. To verify the proposed approach, hardware-in-the-loop experiments are conducted in designed testing scenarios. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23

The TVPP enables presence of commercial buildings and other distributed energy resources in day-ahead (DA) electricity market, as a price maker agent. In this regard, a bilevel optimization framework is designed to optimize the bidding strategy of TVPP in the DA market with the main goal of maximizing TVPP profit. The upper-level problem maximizes the TVPP profit, while in the lower level, market is cleared from independent system operator viewpoint.

393	Cost-Efficient Deployment of Fog Computing Systems at Logistics Centers in Industry 4.0	In Industry 4.0, the factories become increasingly smart and efficient through intelligent cyber-physical systems based on the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT), mobile devices, and cloud computing systems. In practice, the cloud computing system in a factory is managed in a centralized way, and hence may not afford heavy computing loads from thousands of IoT devices in the factory. An approach to address this issue is to deploy fog/edge computing resources nearby IoT devices in a distributed way to provide real-Time computing responses on sites. This paper investigates deployment of an intelligent computing system consisting of a cloud center, gateways, fog devices, edge devices, and sensors attached to facilities in a logistics center. Except for locations of the cloud center and sensors that have been determined based on the factory layout, this paper establishes an integer programing model for deploying gateways, fog devices, edge devices in their respective potential sites, so that the total installation cost is minimized, under the constraints of maximal demand capacity, maximal latency time, coverage, and maximal capacity of devices. This paper further solves this NP-hard facility location problem by a metaheuristic algorithm that incorporates discrete monkey algorithm to search for good quality solutions and genetic algorithm to increase computational efficiency. Simulation verifies high performance of the proposed algorithm in deployment of intelligent computing systems in moderate-scale instances of intelligent logistics centers. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	86
394	Development of a fast numerical simulator for infrared thermography testing signals of delamination defect in a multilayered plate	In this paper, a very fast numerical solver for simulating signal perturbation of infrared thermography testing (IRT) due to delamination defects was developed by using the database of unflawed IRT information. First, the IRT signal simulation method of the frequency-domain summation scheme proposed by authors is briefly introduced as the bases of the present fast-forward solver. Second, a database-type fast numerical scheme for rapid simulation of single-frequency IRT harmonic signals was proposed to enhance the efficiency of the IRT simulation without worsening the numerical precision. In addition, in order to efficiently implement the proposed fast solver for simulation of delamination defects in a multilayered plate, a two-dimensional (2-D) shifting symmetry strategy was applied to reduce the computational burden for the construction of the unflawed database. Based on the proposed scheme, a fast-forward numerical code was developed for simulation of IRT signal perturbation due to the delamination defect. The validity of the proposed scheme and the corresponding numerical code was verified by comparing its results with those of a full FEM code and experiments. It was demonstrated that the database-type fast scheme can significantly reduce the simulation time for the IRT signal perturbation due to a delamination defect but keep the same simulation accuracy with that of the full FEM code. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
395	Human motion analysis and its application to walking stabilization with COG and ZMP	A stability index has been generally used in a gait system of formulaic structure. In this standardized structure, a human model has a center of gravity (COG), while a robot device has a zero moment point (ZMP) with COG as the stability standard in the walking motion. In the gait system of wearable type, the stability of human model is closely related with the robot device, in other words, the COG and ZMP are located in the limited domain of human motion and robot task. In this paper, the human and device are designed individually and the knee joint of human is unconstrained from the device work to allow the human reliance. The stability index that includes the COG and ZMP is defined. The validation of this index is guaranteed through a few tests to describe a correlation between the stability index and the human model condition. Based on the validity of the stability index, the experiment for the walking stabilization is implemented with the ZMP estimation by reaction torque observer. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13

Signal-to-noise ratio analysis is performed to verify the image improvement of the proposed APR-EOF modality from a quantitative point of view. Finally, the experimental results and the physical analysis show that THz is more suitable with respect to the detection of defects in glass fiber lightweight honeycomb composites. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
397	A Continuous Noninvasive Arterial Pressure (CNAP) Approach for Health 4.0 Systems	Health 4.0 can provide effective ways to improve the health status of subjects by taking advantage of cyber-physical systems and Internet of things technologies for the solution of healthcare problems. One of these is represented by suitably estimating blood pressure values of subjects in a continuous, real-time, and noninvasive way. To address it, we propose an approach only requiring a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and a mobile/desktop device. The approach avails itself of genetic programming to automatically find an explicit relationship between blood pressure values and PPG ones. This relationship is tested on a set of 11 subjects and compared against other regression methods, and turns out to be better. Namely, the root-mean-square error values are equal to 8.49 and 6.66 for the systolic and the diastolic blood-pressure values, respectively. Those for the relative error, instead, are equal to 5.55% for the systolic and 6.59% for the diastolic values. © 2018 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	28

399	Latency control in Edge information cache and dissemination for unmanned mobile machines	Unmanned technologies facilitating human activities have been regarded as the most promising innovation to empower fully automatic and intelligent ecosystems. Targeting at extending the processing capabilities of humans, unmanned mobile machines (UMMs) are designated to optimally process the action under varying operating conditions, which relies on prompt information provisioning through existing cellular infrastructures, and renders latency control to information acquisition an inevitable challenge. For this purpose, caching information at network edges has been a remedy for substantial latency reduction, which however ignores practical cell deployment inducing imbalanced wireless services to each UMM in hotspot and rural areas. In this paper, through formulating the Lyapunov function, an algorithm optimizing the utilization of fronthaul resources while stabilizing each UMM's queue is proposed for edge information cache and dissemination in hotspot areas. Furthermore, through formulating the cost measurement as the Cobb-Douglas production function, the optimal beginning time of cache is also derived for UMMs in rural areas. With the provided analytical foundations and simulation studies, the effectiveness of our latency control scheme is fully demonstrated. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
400	Induction infrared thermography and thermal-wave-radar analysis for imaging inspection and diagnosis of blade composites	Condition monitoring, nondestructive testing, and fault diagnosis are currently considered crucial processes for on-condition maintenance (OCM) to increase the reliability and availability of wind turbines and reduce the wind energy generation cost. Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) have been increasingly used to fabricate wind turbine blades. Delamination-type damage is inevitable during manufacture or in-service of a CFRP blade. This inner (subsurface) flaw, usually difficult to be detected by artificial visual inspection or machine vision based on CCD or CMOS, severely degrades the load-bearing capacity of a blade. Induction infrared thermography (IIT) is an emerging infrared machine vision inspection technology, which has the capability of insight to CFRP based on electromagnetic induction and heat conduction. This paper introduces photothermal thermal-wave radar (TWR) nondestructive imaging (NDI) to IIT, based on cross-correlation (CC) pulse compression and matched filtering and applies TWR principles to CFRP imaging inspection and diagnosis. The experimental studies carried out under the transmission mode have shown that TWR B-scan and phasegram can be used to inspect and diagnose subsurface delaminations in CFRP with improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and shape identification. As a new machine vision inspection method, TWRI will play an important role in the OCM of the wind turbine blade. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53
401	Automated dynamic inspection using active infrared thermography	Active thermography is a proven technology used in a wide variety of applications. In the most common approach using a static configuration, the elements involved in the inspection do not move. This presents serious drawbacks when it is applied to the inspection of large products and machines. An alternative approach is the dynamic inspection, which enables the inspection of large and complex products with better resolution, but it is also extremely challenging as data reconstruction is necessary. This work analyzes two methods for dynamic inspection using active infrared thermography: The thermal photocopier and the line scan. Automatic robust methods are proposed to calculate the temperature-time history, producing a pseudostatic sequence that can be further processed using advanced data processing algorithms to improve defect detection. Results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methods and the ability to inspect large products with excellent results. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
402	Leader-Follower Formation Control of USVs with Prescribed Performance and Collision Avoidance	This paper addresses a decentralized leader-follower formation control problem for a group of fully actuated unmanned surface vehicles with prescribed performance and collision avoidance. The vehicles are subject to time-varying external disturbances, and the vehicle dynamics include both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinear functions. The control objective is to make each vehicle follow its reference trajectory and avoid collision between each vehicle and its leader. We consider prescribed performance constraints, including transient and steady-state performance constraints, on formation tracking errors. In the kinematic design, we introduce the dynamic surface control technique to avoid the use of vehicle's acceleration. To compensate for the uncertainties and disturbances, we apply an adaptive control technique to estimate the uncertain parameters including the upper bounds of the disturbances and present neural network approximators to estimate uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, we design a decentralized adaptive formation controller that ensures uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system with prescribed performance and avoids collision between each vehicle and its leader. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the decentralized formation controller. © 2018 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	201
403	Detection of micro solder balls using active thermography technology and K-means algorithm	Solder bump/ball technology has been extensively applied in microelectronic packaging industry. However, the size of solder balls/bumps as well as the pitch are getting smaller and smaller, conventional inspection techniques are insufficient for diagnosis of the defect. It is indispensable to explore new methods for solder joint inspection. In this paper, a nondestructive diagnosis system based on active thermography was proposed. The test vehicles, named as SFA1 and SFA2, were excited by the laser pulse, and the consequent thermal response of the packages was captured by a thermal imager. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the polynomial fit and differential absolute contrast techniques were utilized to reconstruct the thermal images. Then, the statistical features corresponding to each solder ball were extracted from the reconstructed thermal images, and used for clustering analysis with K-means algorithm. The results show that all the solder balls were recognized accurately, which demonstrates that the intelligent system using active thermography and K-means algorithm is effective for defects inspection in microelectronic packaging industry. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23

A wide range of industrial systems such as transportation and manufacturing systems have been developed by integrating cloud computing, fog computing, and IoT infrastructure successfully. However, in this sophisticated system, security and privacy issues are major concerns that hinder the widespread adoptions of these novel techniques. In this paper, we focus on assured data deletion, an issue that is important but received less attention in academia and industry. We first propose a framework to integrate the cloud, the fog, and the things together to manage stored data from industries or individuals. We then focus on secure data deletion in this framework by proposing an assured data deletion scheme that fulfills verifiable data deletion as well as flexible access control over sensitive data. Only data owners and fog devices are involved when deleting cloud data and validating the deletion of these data, which makes the protocol practical due to the features of low latency as well as real-Time interaction with fog. The proposed protocol takes advantage of the attribute-based encryption, whose security can be proved under the standard model.

In this system, the traffic sensor transmits the transportation state information to the remote controller via wireless networks. Due to the broadcast characteristics of the wireless communication, the systems are vulnerable to the eavesdropping and jamming attacks. In this paper, we study how to maximize the secure transmission rate between sensors and the controller in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper and a jammer. Specifically, the malicious jammer is smart and can choose the optimal power strategy to maximize the side effect with the knowledge of sensor's transmission power. For the purpose of achieving the maximum utility, the optimal strategy is determined via adjusting the sensor's transmission power according to the control feedback conditions. We consider the single-antenna model and the multiantenna model to formulate this problem as an optimization problem based on a Stackelberg game. We then prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium via the interaction between the sensor and the jammer. Moreover, we present two algorithms to obtain the optimal transmission strategy, i.e., a stochastic algorithm with feedback and renewed intelligent simulated annealing.

408	Synergy-Based Control of Underactuated Anthropomorphic Hands	In this paper, a grasping control strategy for an anthropomorphic robotic hand in a synergy-based framework is designed. The goal is to achieve a human-like behavior and robustness with respect to detailed information on objects shape and size. By adapting to underactuated kinematics a well-aimed method for human grasps mapping, the synergies subspace is computed. The designed control strategy allows the hand to adapt to object contours by means of coordinated fingers motion in the synergies subspace, and it is composed of a feedforward and two corrective terms to generate fingertip reference positions. The feedforward term is obtained by choosing, among the configurations contained in the set of grasps used for synergies computation, the one that is closest to the target grasp. This term ensures a suitable preshaping of the hand in the synergies subspace on the basis of object and grasp features. On the other hand, in order to adapt the grasp to the object, a weighted sum of two corrective terms is computed using the state of the motors as the feedback of the control law. The first term is designed to generate the closure of the hand towards the object. The second term is designed to optimize a grasp quality index based on force closure property. Moreover, exploiting the motor current feedback, soft synergies are implemented realizing compliance at the contact. The experiments conducted on the underactuated SCHUNK five-finger hand demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	17

In order to implement a robust inspection system with higher accuracy, we propose a deep learning based classification model in this paper, which can find the possible defective products. As there may be many assembly lines in one factory, one huge problem in this scenario is how to process such big data in real time. Therefore, we design our system with the concept of fog computing. By offloading the computation burden from the central server to the fog nodes, the system obtains the ability to deal with extremely large data. There are two obvious advantages in our system. The first one is that we adapt the convolutional neural network model to the fog computing environment, which significantly improves its computing efficiency. The other one is that we work out an inspection model, which can simultaneously indicate the defect type and its degree.

To this end, we propose in this paper a hierarchical fog servers' deployment at the network service layer across different tiers. Using probabilistic analysis models, we prove the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical fog computing compared with the flat architecture. In this paper, IIoT data and requests are divided into both high priority and low priority requests; the high priority requests are urgent/emergency demands that need to be scheduled rapidly. Therefore, we use two-priority queuing model in order to schedule and analyze IIoT data. Finally, we further introduce a workload assignment algorithm to offload peak loads over higher tiers of the fog hierarchy. Using realistic industrial data from Bosch group, the benefits of the proposed architecture compared to the conventional flat design are proved using various performance metrics and through extensive simulations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	107

416	Reconfigurable smart factory for drug packing in healthcare industry 4.0	Industry 4.0, which exploits cyber-physical systems and represents digital transformation of manufacturing, is deeply affecting healthcare as well as other traditional production sector. To accommodate the increasing demand of agility, flexibility, and low cost in healthcare sector, a data-driven reconfigurable production mode of Smart Factory for pharmaceutical manufacturing is proposed in this paper. The architecture of the Smart Factory is consisted of three primary layers, namely perception layer, deployment layer, and executing layer. A Manufacturing's Semantics Ontology based knowledgebase is introduced in the perception layer, which is responsible for plan scheduling of pharmaceutical production. The reconfigurable plans are generated from the production demand of drugs as well as the information statement of low-level machine resources. To further functionality reconfiguration and low-level controlling, the IEC 61499 standard is also introduced for functionality modeling and machine controlling. We verify the proposed method with an experiment of demand-based drug packing production, which reflects the feasibility and adequate flexibility of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	74
417	Shortest Path Planning for Energy-Constrained Mobile Platforms Navigating on Uneven Terrains	Finding a shortest feasible path between two given locations is a common problem in many real-world applications. Previous studies have shown that mobile platforms would consume excessive energy when moving along shortest paths on uneven terrains, which often consist of rapid elevation changes. Mobile platforms powered by portable energy sources may fail to follow such paths due to the limited energy available. This paper proposes a new heuristic search algorithm called constraints satisfying A∗ (CSA) to find solutions to such resource constrained shortest path problems. When CSA∗ is guided by admissible heuristics, it guarantees to find a globally optimal solution to a given constrained search problem if such a solution exists. When CSA∗ is guided by consistent heuristics, it is optimally efficient over a class of equally informed admissible constrained search algorithms with respect to the set of paths expanded. Test results obtained using real terrain data verify the applicability of the proposed algorithm in shortest path planning for energy-constrained mobile platforms on uneven terrains. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
418	Service Popularity-Based Smart Resources Partitioning for Fog Computing-Enabled Industrial Internet of Things	Recently, fog computing has gained increasing attention in processing the computing tasks of the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) with different service popularity. In task-diversified fog computing-enabled IIoT (F-IIoT), the mismatch between expected computing efficiency and partitioned resources on fog nodes (FNs) may pose serious traffic congestion even large-scale industrial service interruptions. The existing works mainly studied offloading which type of computing tasks into FNs, but few studies enabled smart resource partitioning of FNs. In this paper, a service popularity-based smart resources partitioning (SPSRP) scheme is proposed for fog computing-enabled IIoT. We first exploit Zipf's law to model the relationship between popularity ranks and computing costs of IIoT services. Moreover, we propose an implementation architecture of the SPSRP scheme for F-IIoT, which decouples the computing control layer from data processing layer of IIoT through a specified SPSRP controller. Besides, a mobility and heterogeneity-Aware partitioning algorithm is presented for extending SPSRP scheme to seamlessly support cross-domain resources partitioning. The simulations demonstrate that the SPSRP scheme can bring notable performance improvements on delay time, successful response rate and fault tolerance for fog computing to deal with the large-scale IIoT services. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	109
419	Adaptive Fog Configuration for the Industrial Internet of Things	Industrial fog computing deploys various industrial services, such as automatic monitoring/control and imminent failure detection, at the fog nodes (FNs) to improve the performance of industrial systems. Much effort has been made in the literature on the design of fog network architecture and computation offloading. This paper studies an equally important but much less investigated problem of service hosting where FNs are adaptively configured to host services for sensor nodes (SNs), thereby enabling corresponding tasks to be executed by the FNs. The problem of service hosting emerges because of the limited computational and storage resources at FNs, which limit the number of different types of services that can be hosted by an FN at the same time. Considering the variability of service demand in both temporal and spatial dimensions, when, where, and which services to host have to be judiciously decided to maximize the utility of the fog computing network. Our proposed fog configuration strategies are tailored to battery-powered FNs. The limited battery capacity of FNs creates a long-term energy budget constraint that significantly complicates the fog configuration problem as it introduces temporal coupling of decision making across the timeline. To address all these challenges, we propose an online distributed algorithm, called adaptive fog configuration (AFC), based on Lyapunov optimization and parallel Gibbs sampling. AFC jointly optimizes service hosting and task admission decisions, requiring only currently available system information while guaranteeing close-to-optimal performance compared to an oracle algorithm with full future information. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	46
420	Hierarchically Adaptive Frequency Control for an EV-Integrated Smart Grid with Renewable Energy	With the technology development of intelligent power generation and consumption, more and more electric vehicles (EVs), smart loads, and renewable energy are linked up to smart grids. In this paper, due to the great response ability of EVs, a large number of aggregate EVs are considered to improve the frequency response. From this point of view, for an EV-integrated smart grid with loads and renewable energy, a novel hierarchically adaptive control strategy is developed including both the primary controller and the EV controller when power mismatches happen. The sliding-mode primary controller is used to stabilize the frequency by operating power plants, while the EV controller is designed by using adaptive dynamic programming to deal with most of the frequency deviation. Simulation is validated on a benchmark smart grid by comparative studies to demonstrate the superior performance of hierarchically adaptive frequency control as well as the benefit of using EVs in the frequency regulation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	48
421	A Comparison of Partitioning Strategies for Fixed Points Based Limited Preemptive Scheduling	The increasing industrial demand for handling complex functionalities has influenced the design of hardware architectures for time critical embedded systems, during the past decade. Multicore systems facilitate the inclusion of many complex functionalities, while, at the same time, inducing cache related overheads, as well as adding partitioning complexity to the overall system schedulability. One of the efficient paradigms for controlling and reducing the cache related costs in real-time systems is limited preemptive scheduling (LPS), with its particular instance fixed preemption points scheduling (LP-FPPS), which has been shown to outperform other alternatives as well as has been supported by and investigated in the automotive domain. With respect to the partitioning constraints, partitioned scheduling has been widely used to preruntime allocate tasks to specific cores, resulting in predictable cache-related preemption delays estimations. In this paper, we propose to integrate the LP-FPPS and partitioned scheduling on fixed-priority multicore real-time systems in order to increase the overall system schedulability. We define a new joint approach for task partitioning and preemption point selection, which is based on the computation of the maximum blocking tolerance upon each allocation, thus being able to quantify the schedulability of the taskset on each processor. Furthermore, we investigate the partitioning strategies based on different heuristics, i.e., first fit decreasing and worst fit decreasing, and priority and density taskset orderings. The evaluation performed on randomly generated tasksets shows that in the general case, no single partitioning strategy fully dominates the others. However, the evaluation results reveal that the certain partitioning strategies perform significantly better with respect to the overall schedulability for specific taskset characteristics. The results also reveal that the proposed partitioning strategies outperform fully preemptive and nonpreemptive partitioned scheduling in terms of successful partitioning. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	
422	Fast Semantic Segmentation for Scene Perception	Semantic segmentation is a challenging problem in computer vision. Many applications, such as autonomous driving and robot navigation with urban road scene, need accurate and efficient segmentation. Most state-of-the-art methods focus on accuracy, rather than efficiency. In this paper, we propose a more efficient neural network architecture, which has fewer parameters, for semantic segmentation in the urban road scene. An asymmetric encoder-decoder structure based on ResNet is used in our model. In the first stage of encoder, we use continuous factorized block to extract low-level features. Continuous dilated block is applied in the second stage, which ensures that the model has a larger view field, while keeping the model small-scale and shallow. The down sampled features from encoder are up sampled with decoder to the same-size output as the input image and the details refined. Our model can achieve end-to-end and pixel-to-pixel training without pretraining from scratch. The parameters of our model are only 0.2M, 100 × less than those of others such as SegNet, etc. Experiments are conducted on five public road scene datasets (CamVid, CityScapes, Gatech, KITTI Road Detection, and KITTI Semantic Segmentation), and the results demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53
423	TEAM Applications for Collaborative Road Mobility	The tomorrow's elastic adaptive mobility industrial research project developed eleven collaborative mobility apps addressing various traffic issues and scenarios. The apps, involving different aspects and degrees of collaboration (e.g., direct user participation, shared objectives, coordination, etc.), aim at increasing the driver/traveler awareness and support a better behavior. This paper describes the apps and the underlying system architecture shared by the participating car manufacturers. Then, it provides a user acceptance analysis grouping the apps according to the three main types of users and stakeholders: drivers, travelers, and administrators/operators. Data, collected in five European countries, shows that acceptance and expected impact are positive. The actual road-test experience did not diminish the high expectations raised by an initial presentation on paper, showing a good maturity of the prototypes. The Administrator app cluster shows a slightly better assessment, highlighting the importance of considering collaborative mobility as a system, including road, infrastructure, and traffic management. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
424	A Secure Content Caching Scheme for Disaster Backup in Fog Computing Enabled Mobile Social Networks	Caching content with fog computing at the edge nodes has been a promising alternative to mitigate burdens of backbone networks and improve mobile users' quality of experience in mobile social networks (MSNs). However, as edge node may be vulnerable due to the attacks from malicious users, the design of secure caching schemes for the fog/edge enabled MSNs becomes a new challenge. In this paper, to tackle the above problem, we propose a secure caching scheme for disaster backup in MSNs with fog computing. Specifically, to protect the privacy, a partitioning and scrambling method is first designed to encrypt the contents. Then, the encrypted contents are replicated to multiple replicates, where these replicates are delivered and stored in different servers. Based on the recovery time objective and content delivery latency, an auction game model is developed to determine the optimal servers, where both edge nodes and cloud servers can obtain the maximum utilities. Extensive simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	54
425	Tasks Scheduling and Resource Allocation in Fog Computing Based on Containers for Smart Manufacturing	Fog computing has been proposed as an extension of cloud computing to provide computation, storage, and network services in network edge. For smart manufacturing, fog computing can provide a wealth of computational and storage services, such as fault detection and state analysis of devices in assembly lines, if the middle layer between the industrial cloud and the terminal device is considered. However, limited resources and low-delay services hinder the application of new virtualization technologies in the task scheduling and resource management of fog computing. Thus, we build a new task-scheduling model by considering the role of containers. Then, we construct a task-scheduling algorithm to ensure that the tasks are completed on time and the number of concurrent tasks for the fog node is optimized. Finally, we propose a reallocation mechanism to reduce task delays in accordance with the characteristics of the containers. The results showed that our proposed task-scheduling algorithm and reallocation scheme can effectively reduce task delays and improve the concurrency number of the tasks in fog nodes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	173
426	Development of Vibrotactile Pedestal with Multiple Actuators and Application of Haptic Illusions for Information Delivery	In this study, a vibrotactile pedestal with multiple actuators is developed and applied to smartphones to create a sense of information according to location and direction. As the main goal is to create a detailed sensation with a limited number of actuators, well-known sensory illusion effects are utilized to modulate vibrotactile stimuli to create an appropriate sensation. The monolithic design concept is utilized to the touch surface of the pedestal for a smooth grip so that there is no interference with screen interaction of the smartphone. Two experiments were conducted to validate whether the developed device could successfully reproduce directional and locational information according to given visual data. The results show that vibrotactile stimulation from the pedestal was useful in intuitively displaying information such as position and direction for smartphone applications. The implications of the work presented in this paper can serve as a stepping stone toward the development of smartphone applications with affluent sensory information through vibrotactile stimulation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
427	An efficient iterative learning approach to time-optimal path tracking for industrial robots	In pursuit of the time-optimal motion of an industrial robot along a desired path, a previously identified model is typically used to calculate the required inputs for perfect tracking. An inevitable model-plant mismatch, however, causes the obtained inputs to be suboptimal-resulting in poor tracking performance-or even be infeasible by exceeding given limits. This paper, at hand, presents a two-step iterative learning algorithm that compensates for such model-plant mismatch and finds the time-optimal motion, improving tracking performance, and ensuring feasibility. Due to an efficient solution of the path tracking problem using a sequential convex log barrier method, the delay between consecutive task executions is eliminated. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, an experimental validation on a standard industrial manipulator is performed, illustrating that the developed approach is capable of reducing the execution time while at the same time improving the tracking performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22
428	Security/Timing-Aware Design Space Exploration of CAN FD for Automotive Cyber-Physical Systems	The controller area network with flexible data-rate (CAN FD) is the new generation of the CAN technology to meet the daily increasing bandwidth requirement for automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPS). However, ACPS is a security-critical system, an efficient security/timing-aware design space exploration (DSE) method is required to fully utilize CAN FD's high data phase data rate. In this paper, we propose an AUTOSAR-compliant system model that integrates both timing and security constraint, an integrated mixed-integer linear programming formulation (i-MILP) for the optimal DSE of CAN FD, and a divide-and-conquer approach to the i-MILP (dc-MILP) to address its timing complexity problem. The experiment results show that dc-MILP scales well for industrial-size systems and saves 1.94%-4.76% bandwidth utilization and guarantees the schedulability for more signal sets by comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25
429	Detection of Malicious Code Variants Based on Deep Learning	With the development of the Internet, malicious code attacks have increased exponentially, with malicious code variants ranking as a key threat to Internet security. The ability to detect variants of malicious code is critical for protection against security breaches, data theft, and other dangers. Current methods for recognizing malicious code have demonstrated poor detection accuracy and low detection speeds. This paper proposed a novel method that used deep learning to improve the detection of malware variants. In prior research, deep learning demonstrated excellent performance in image recognition. To implement our proposed detection method, we converted the malicious code into grayscale images. Then, the images were identified and classified using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that could extract the features of the malware images automatically. In addition, we utilized a bat algorithm to address the data imbalance among different malware families. To test our approach, we conducted a series of experiments on malware image data from Vision Research Lab. The experimental results demonstrated that our model achieved good accuracy and speed as compared with other malware detection models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	356
430	Topology Management and TSCH Scheduling for Low-Latency Convergecast in In-Vehicle WSNs	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are considered as a promising solution in intravehicle networking to reduce wiring and production costs. This application requires reliable and real-time data delivery, while the network is very dense. The time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a reliable solution for low-power networks through guaranteed medium access and channel diversity. However, satisfying the stringent requirements of in-vehicle networks is challenging and demands for special consideration in network formation and TSCH scheduling. This paper targets convergecast in dense in-vehicle WSNs, in which all nodes can potentially directly reach the sink node. A cross-layer low-latency topology management and TSCH scheduling (LLTT) technique is proposed that provides a very high timeslot utilization for the TSCH schedule and minimizes communication latency. It first picks a topology for the network that increases the potential of parallel TSCH communications. Then, by using an optimized graph isomorphism algorithm, it extracts a proper match in the physical connectivity graph of the network for the selected topology. This network topology is used by a lightweight TSCH schedule generator to provide low data delivery latency. Two techniques, namely grouped retransmission and periodic aggregation, are exploited to increase the performance of the TSCH communications. The experimental results show that LLTT reduces the end-to-end communication latency compared to other approaches, while keeping the communications reliable by using dedicated links and grouped retransmissions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22
431	D2D Communications in Heterogeneous Networks with Full-Duplex Relays and Edge Caching	This paper studies the joint optimal resource allocation and probabilistic caching design for device-To-device (D2D) communications in a wireless heterogeneous network with full-duplex (FD) relays. In particular, popular contents can be cached at user devices as well as at relays that are located close to users. A user can request contents from another user via D2D communications and also from a nearby relay equipped with FD radios. In the case that there is a caching miss (i.e., the requested contents are not found at the other users/relays within the coverage range), users can connect to the base station via a relay by using the FD communication technology. Subsequently, we develop mathematical models to analyze the throughput performance with edge caching where both cochannel system level interference and FD self-interference are considered. Due to the high complexity of stochastic optimization, we develop low-complexity optimization formulation by decomposing the original problem into three simple subproblems that can be efficiently solved. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate developed theoretical findings in the paper and significant performance gains of the throughput performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	32
432	Deploying Fog Computing in Industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0	Rapid technological advances have revolutionized the industrial sector. These advances range from automation of industrial processes to autonomous industrial processes, where a human input is not required. Internet of Things (IoT), which has emerged a few years ago, has been embraced by industry, resulting in what is known as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IIoT refers to making industrial processes and entities part of the Internet. Restricting the definition of IIoT to manufacturing yields another subset of IoT, known as Industry 4.0. IIoT and Industry 4.0, will consist of sensor networks, actuators, robots, machines, appliances, business processes, and personnel. Hence, a lot of data of diverse nature would be generated. The industrial process requires most of the tasks to be performed locally because of delay and security requirements and structured data to be communicated over the Internet to web services and the cloud. To achieve this task, middleware support is required between the industrial environment and the cloud/web services. In this context, fog is a potential middleware that can be very useful for different industrial scenarios. Fog can provide local processing support with acceptable latency to actuators and robots in a manufacturing industry. Additionally, as industrial big data are often unstructured, it can be trimmed and refined by the fog locally, before sending it to the cloud. We present an architectural overview of IIoT and Industry 4.0. We discuss how fog can provide local computing support in the IIoT environment and the core elements and building blocks of IIoT. We also present a few interesting prospective use cases of IIoT. Finally, we discuss some emerging research challenges related to IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	334
433	A Robotic System with Multichannel Flexible Parallel Manipulators for Single Port Access Surgery	Robot-assisted single port access surgery (SPAS) brings significant benefits to the patients. However, it is challenging due to the limited incision size and requirements in precision, load capacity, and dexterity. To address these challenges, this paper presents a multichannel SPAS robotic system consisting of two channels of 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) flexible manipulators and an endoscope channel. Each channel of the manipulators is designed based on a 3-DOF parallel mechanism with three sets of super-elastic Ni-Ti rods and universal joints. This design optimizes the structure for flexibility and safety considerations with a simplified structure compared with conventional parallel mechanisms. Flexible shafts are used for torque transmission from the actuation unit, allowing the motors to be farther away from the patient-side robotic system. The kinematics of the manipulator is derived, and then the reachable workspace and dexterity are analyzed. Furthermore, a prototype of the proposed robotic system is presented and evaluated through adequate experiments. The flexibility of the manipulator is verified via stiffness characterization test. The results of the accuracy tests confirmed that the robotic system can implement manipulation arm with acceptable accuracy. The feasibility and effectiveness of applying the robotic system to the practical operation are also demonstrated through experimentations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	35
434	Double Auction-Based Resource Allocation for Mobile Edge Computing in Industrial Internet of Things	Mobile edge computing (MEC) yields significant paradigm shift in industrial Internet of things (IIoT), by bringing resource-rich data center near to the lightweight IIoT mobile devices (MDs). In MEC, resource allocation and network economics need to be jointly addressed to maximize system efficiency and incentivize price-driven agents, whereas this joint problem is under the locality constraints, i.e., an edge server can only serve multiple IIoT MDs in the vicinity constrained by its limited computing resource. In this paper, we investigate the joint problem of network economics and resource allocation in MEC where IIoT MDs request offloading with claimed bids and edge servers provide their limited computing service with ask prices. Particularly, we propose two double auction schemes with dynamic pricing in MEC, namely a breakeven-based double auction (BDA) and a more efficient dynamic pricing based double auction (DPDA), to determine the matched pairs between IIoT MDs and edge servers, as well as the pricing mechanisms for high system efficiency, under the locality constraints. Through theoretical analysis, both algorithms are proved to be budget-balanced, individual profit, system efficient, and truthful. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms and the simulation results indicate that the proposed DPDA and BDA can significantly improve the system efficiency of MEC in IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	123

437	Distributed Fog Computing Based on Batched Sparse Codes for Industrial Control	In an industrial automation system, one of the most important parts is control loop. Fog computing is a potential solution for industrial control in time-critical applications as it provides distributed computing services closer to the connected devices. However, a huge amount of data exchanging among fog nodes causes high communication load, which constrains the overall response time from fog nodes to actuators. In this paper, we consider the erasure environment, batched sparse (BATS) codes are applied to the Map and the Data Shuffling stages of distributed fog computing process to reduce both the communication and the computation loads. The communication loads of the uncoded, the coded, and the proposed BATS-based schemes over erasure channels are calculated, respectively.

438	Robust Decentralized Controller Synthesis in Flexure-Linked H-Gantry by Iterative Linear Programming	The dual-drive H-gantry is widely used for high-speed, high-precision Cartesian motion. Compared with the conventional rigid-linked design, the flexure-linked counterpart is able to prevent the damage of joints for its smaller interaxial coupling force. However, there are still barriers to further push up its precision, such as parametric uncertainties due to the inaccurate dynamical model, the possible induced vibration during high-speed motion, and the decentralized control structure required by industries. To maintain the tracking precision of carriages and minimize the vibration of the end effector, we aim to optimize parameters in decentralized controllers with choices of flexure pieces. We find that such decentralized feedback structure yields some uncontrollable but stabilizable states in the closed-loop system, and no direct solution from solving the algebraic Riccati equation is available in this case. Such structural constraint, together with constraints due to stability requirement and model uncertainties facilitates us to formulate an $\mathcal {H}-2$ guaranteed cost control problem within a projected convex domain. From here, efficient numerical procedures are developed to obtain the global optimum by iterative linear programming. The real-time experiment validates the optimality and the robustness of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26

In this paper, we present a hierarchical model predictive power dispatch and control strategy for a class of modern power systems with price-elastic controllable loads (CLs) in energy Internet. In the upper-level optimization, a generalized multiperiod economic dispatch (GMPED) problem is organized within an electricity market environment aiming at maximizing the social welfare. Specifically, the price-elastic CLs are aggregated in controllable load aggregators (CLAs) to participate in the market competition. A novel utility function of the price-elastic CLAs is proposed for market demand response.

442	Nonlinear High-Gain Observer-Based Diagnosis and Compensation for Actuator and Sensor Faults in a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle	This paper studies the diagnosis and compensation for sensor and actuator faults in a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. Without adding sensors or actuators for increased hardware redundancy, an observer-based adaptive controller is proposed to estimate and compensate for the faults. First, using a feedback linearization technique, an inner controller is designed to transform the form of the considered quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle with faults into a nonlinear system with Lipschitz-like nonlinearities and parametric faulty models. Second, the estimations for unmeasurable state and actuator faults are performed in an output-feedback outer controller to compensate for the actuator faults. Third, a nonlinear high-gain observer is designed to provide the information of the state and faults to the outer controller, with the compensations for sensor faults. A Lyapunov-based analysis shows that appropriate choices of the controller parameters can guarantee the exponential convergence of errors in estimation and trajectory tracking under uncertainties and faults. The robustness to the external disturbances is also discussed. Simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The proposed approach is also implemented on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle to show its feasibility in real-Time applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	54

444	Adaptive Scheduling for Multicluster Time-Triggered Train Communication Networks	The execution time of conventional incremental off-line schedule approaches for time-triggered networks increases rapidly when networks become larger. When the traffic in a network changes, they need to reschedule all influenced flows once again. Traffic changes at the cluster level involve many data flows. An incremental scheduler cannot react quickly to such changes. We propose an algorithm based on mixed integer linear programming and counterexample guided methodology. Our algorithm can generate adaptive schedule for cluster-level changes of the system. The adaptive schedule can react quickly to the changes during runtime. Our algorithm enhances the incremental schedulers. It allows schedulers to react to changing at both the flow level and the cluster level. Experiments show that our approach is effective. In the scenarios of coupling train consists, our algorithm can generate the schedule table of the train network within a few seconds. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
445	Highly Accurate Machine Fault Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning	We develop a novel deep learning framework to achieve highly accurate machine fault diagnosis using transfer learning to enable and accelerate the training of deep neural network. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method is faster to train and more accurate. First, original sensor data are converted to images by conducting a Wavelet transformation to obtain time-frequency distributions. Next, a pretrained network is used to extract lower level features. The labeled time-frequency images are then used to fine-tune the higher levels of the neural network architecture. This paper creates a machine fault diagnosis pipeline and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and generalization of the pipeline on three main mechanical datasets including induction motors, gearboxes, and bearings with sizes of 6000, 9000, and 5000 time series samples, respectively. We achieve state-of-the-art results on each dataset, with most datasets showing test accuracy near 100%, and in the gearbox dataset, we achieve significant improvement from 94.8% to 99.64%.

446	Robust Continuous Wheel Slip Control with Reference Adaptation: Application to the Brake System with Decoupled Architecture	Modern and coming generations of electric and automated vehicles are characterized by higher requirements to robust and fault-tolerant operation of chassis systems independently from driving situations and road conditions. In this regard, this paper introduces an adaptive continuous wheel slip control (WSC) developed for the sport utility vehicle equipped with a high-dynamic decoupled electrohydraulic brake system. The system architecture, mathematical formulation of the WSC and state estimator as well as the experimental WSC validation is described in this paper. The focus is given on three continuous WSC strategies based on proportional integral (PI), sliding-mode PI and integral-sliding-mode control techniques. The proposed WSC also includes the state and parameter estimator for the adaptation of the reference wheel slip depending on current road conditions and using the standard on-board vehicle sensors and extremum-seeking algorithm. Adaptability and robustness of all WSC configurations were confirmed by the road experiments performed on low- and high-μ surfaces with mandatory condition of the same controls adjustments for all test cases. Tests show an enhancement of the vehicle safety and ride quality, compared to the vehicle with the rule-based WSC control. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	36

448	SAFE: SDN-Assisted Framework for Edge-Cloud Interplay in Secure Healthcare Ecosystem	Improved quality of life has lead the healthcare industry to geographically expand and support real-Time services. Following this trend, a surge of healthcare monitoring devices has substantially overgrown in the global market. These devices tend to generate data in humongous quantity that need real-Time analysis with seamless and secure transmission to the computing nodes.

449	Probability of detection for eddy current pulsed thermography of angular defect quantification	Eddy current pulsed thermography (ECPT) as one of the emerging nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) techniques has been used for the evaluation of the integrity of rail tracks, especially for rolling contact fatigue (RCF) detection and crack sizing. This paper proposes a probability of detection (POD) analysis framework for the ECPT system. Specifically, three different features, i.e., max thermal response, first-order differential imaging, and ratio mapping of the first-order differential imaging, were used to quantify the length of the angular slot by linear fitting. Based on the fitting relation between these features and the slot length, POD curves for linear-coil-based ECPT system of angular defect detection were calculated and compared. Results show that the max thermal response feature has the highest repeatability and detectability for shorter slot detection. First-order differential imaging and ratio mapping features are more convincing for longer slot detection. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
450	Development of Multitarget Acquisition, Pointing, and Tracking System for Airborne Laser Communication	Cluster unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely demanded. To achieve high rate and large capacity communication with cluster UAVs, one of the key but still challenge task is to perform multitarget acquisition, pointing, and tracking (APT) under complex airborne environment. To solve this problem, this paper gives one composite axis APT system for multitarget laser communication with cluster UAVs. The APT system consists of a gimbal mirror and piezoelectric fast steering mirrors (FSMs), which can achieve independent and synchronous control of multiple optical axes. The cascade control scheme is designed for the gimbal mirror and the H$\infty$ controller is designed for the FSM. To further improve the control accuracy, the hysteresis compensator based on least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) is proposed. The pruning error minimization method of LS-SVM is applied to reduce the computational cost. The simulation studies validate the control performance of the multitarget APT system. Finally, the experimental prototype is developed. The experimental results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed multitarget APT system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25

452	Brain Network Analysis of Compressive Sensed High-Density EEG Signals in AD and MCI Subjects	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes a loss of connections between neurons. The goal of this paper is to construct a complex network model of the brain-electrical activity, using high-density EEG (HD-EEG) recordings, and to compare the network organization in AD, mild cognitive impaired (MCI), and healthy control (CNT) subjects. The HD-EEG of 16 AD, 16 MCI, and 12 CNT was recorded during an eye-closed resting state. The permutation disalignment index (PDI) was used to describe the dissimilarity between EEG signals and to construct the connection matrices of the network model. The three groups were found to have significantly different (p < 0.001) characteristic path length (λ), average clustering coefficient (CC), and the global efficiency (GE). This is the first time that HD-EEG signals of AD, MCI, and CNT have been compared and that PDI has been used to discriminate between the three groups. Considering the large amount of data originating from HD-EEG acquisition, compared to standard EEG, the aim of this paper is also to assess that compression did not alter the results of the complex network analysis. Compressive sensing was adopted to compress and reconstruct the HD-EEG signals with minimal information loss, achieving an average structural similarity index of 0.954 (AD), 0.957 (MCI), and 0.959 (CNT). When applied to the reconstructed HD-EEG, complex network analysis provided a substantially unaltered performance, compared to the analysis of the original signals: λ, CC, and GE of the three groups were indeed still significantly different (p < 0.001). © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	49
453	Spectrum Allocation and Power Optimization for Demand-Side Cooperative and Cognitive Communications in Smart Grid	In this paper, we optimize power and spectrum allocation simultaneously to improve the demand-side communication quality in smart grid, to further reduce the cost of utility companies. The electricity cost is first modeled based on regulation errors caused by direct load control in the smart grid. Then the subbands are allocated to different data aggregator units according to the band confidence levels and the utility company's maximum cost. An algorithm is designed to optimize transmission power of the relay and refine the spectrum allocation to reduce the cost of utility companies. Simulation results demonstrate that the packet loss rate and cost of utility companies can be significantly reduced. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
454	A Two-Stage Approach for the Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Bearings Using Deep Neural Networks	The degradation of bearings plays a key role in the failures of industrial machinery. Prognosis of bearings is critical in adopting an optimal maintenance strategy to reduce the overall cost and to avoid unwanted downtime or even casualties by estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of the bearings. Traditional data-driven approaches of RUL prediction rely heavily on manual feature extraction and selection using human expertise. This paper presents an innovative two-stage automated approach to estimate the RUL of bearings using deep neural networks (DNNs). A denoising autoencoder-based DNN is used to classify the acquired signals of the monitored bearings into different degradation stages. Representative features are extracted directly from the raw signal by training the DNN. Then, regression models based on shallow neural networks are constructed for each health stage. The final RUL result is obtained by smoothing the regression results from different models. The proposed approach has achieved satisfactory prediction performance for a real bearing degradation dataset with different working conditions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	134
455	Feedback Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with Fuzzy Reward for Robotic Multiple Peg-in-Hole Assembly Tasks	The automatic completion of multiple peg-in-hole assembly tasks by robots remains a formidable challenge because the traditional control strategies require a complex analysis of the contact model. In this paper, the assembly task is formulated as a Markov decision process, and a model-driven deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed to accomplish the assembly task through the learned policy without analyzing the contact states. In our algorithm, the learning process is driven by a simple traditional force controller. In addition, a feedback exploration strategy is proposed to ensure that our algorithm can efficiently explore the optimal assembly policy and avoid risky actions, which can address the data efficiency and guarantee stability in realistic assembly scenarios. To improve the learning efficiency, we utilize a fuzzy reward system for the complex assembly process. Then, simulations and realistic experiments of a dual peg-in-hole assembly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The advantages of the fuzzy reward system and feedback exploration strategy are validated by comparing the performances of different cases in simulations and experiments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	61
456	Spatial Information Enhances Myoelectric Control Performance with only Two Channels	Automatic gesture recognition (AGR) is investigated as an effortless human-machine interaction method, potentially applied in many industrial sectors. When using surface electromyogram (sEMG) for AGR, i.e., myoelectric control, a minimum of four EMG channels are required. However, in practical applications, fewer number of electrodes is always preferred, particularly for mobile and wearable applications. No published research focused on how to improve the performance of a myoelectric system with only two sEMG channels. In this study, we presented a systematic investigation to fill this gap. Specifically, we demonstrated that through spatial filtering and electrode position optimization, the myoelectric control performance was significantly improved (p < 0.05) and similar to that with four electrodes. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between offline and online performance metrics in the two-channel system, indicating that offline performance was transferable to online performance, highly relevant for algorithm development for sEMG-based AGR applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
457	Model-Based Coordinated Control of Four-Wheel Independently Driven Skid Steer Mobile Robot with Wheel-Ground Interaction and Wheel Dynamics	Four-wheel independently driven mobile robots are widely used in industrial automation, intelligent inspection, and outdoor exploration. The traditional kinematic control is usually applied for them, where only the chassis kinematics is taken into account and the robot dynamics (especially the wheel dynamics) is normally ignored. It may lead to some performance limitations such as the chattering phenomenon during robot rotating, because of the overactuation characteristic by four driving wheels. To address these problems, the integrated dynamic model is proposed, which includes chassis kinematics, chassis dynamics, wheel-ground interaction, and wheel dynamics. Subsequently, different from kinematic control, a model-based coordinated adaptive robust controller is developed, which generally consists of three-level designs for different parts of robot dynamics, and directly generates the motor driving torque commands for four wheels. The stability and tracking performance are theoretically guaranteed. Comparative experiments are carried out, and the results show the better performance of our proposed scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	50

459	Terahertz amplitude polynomial principle component regression for aramid-basalt hybrid composite laminate inspection	As an emerging nondestructive diagnostic and monitoring technique, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) imagery is attracting more attention. In this regard, new THz image processing algorithms based on infrared thermography (IRT) concepts are greatly needed, since most IRT imagery modalities are fast for in-line industrial inspection. However, this scenario is difficult due to some physical constraints to be reached, although this idea should be followed to avoid the loss of useful information during image processing. In this paper, a novel THz amplitude polynomial principle component regression (APPCR) algorithm is proposed for the inspection of aramid-basalt hybrid composite laminates. This algorithm segments THz amplitude-frequency curves to simulate heating-up and cooling-down behaviors as in IRT; in addition, it uses an empirical orthogonal functions-based principle component regression modality to simplify the THz image analysis procedure. This experimental and analytical study shows that APPCR can, first, simplify the THz image analysis procedure, and second, enhance image contrast and spatial resolution. A theoretical analysis was conducted as experimental explanation, while the IRT imagery results were used for comparative purposes. In addition, signal-to-noise ratio analysis was used to evaluate quantitatively the image enhancement. Finally, it is possible to conclude that THz is more suitable to inspect transparent or semitransparent materials. Advantages and disadvantages of THz-TDS and IRT are summarized in the text. © 2018 IEEE.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
460	Adaptive Motion Planning Based on Vehicle Characteristics and Regulations for Off-Road UGVs	In this paper, we propose a novel motion planning method for off-road unmanned ground vehicles, based on three-dimensional (3-D) terrain map information. Previous studies on the motion planning of a vehicle traveling on rough terrain dealt only with a relatively small environment. Furthermore, unique vehicle characteristics were not considered, and it was also impossible to incorporate regulations, such as maintaining driving speed and suppressing posture change. The proposed method enables vehicles to adaptively generate a path by considering vehicle characteristics and the regulations, in a large-scale environment, with rough terrain. A random sampling based scheme was applied to carrying out global path planning, based on a 3-D environmental model. Experimental results showed that the proposed off-road motion planner could generate an appropriate path, which satisfies vehicle characteristics and predefined regulations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
461	Graphene-Grid Deployment in Energy Harvesting Cooperative Wireless Sensor Networks for Green IoT	Energy harvesting (EH) technology is an effective way to resolve the energy supply problem for green Internet of Things application.

In this paper, we focus on EH cooperative wireless sensor networks (EHC-WSNs), a new type of WSNs that integrates EH and wireless energy transfer technologies to provide the continuous and controllable energy supply. We propose the graphene-grid deployment strategy to guarantee energy coverage and network connectivity, whereby a Graphene-based Energy Cooperation Management (GECM) mechanism is designed under the energy-neutral operation. Furthermore, we divide GECM into two different phases, i.e., graphene-based energy cooperative charging strategy and graphene-based opportunistic cooperative routing algorithm, which are optimized according to the graphene-grid structure. Extensive simulations show that the proposed GECM can maximize the harvested energy utilization and prolong the network lifetime. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	28

Then, we used a normal-vector-based method to determine the pose of the robotic arm corresponding to each scan point in the scan path. In addition, two force sensors could feedback the contact force between the scanned tissue and the emission plane of the probe for fine-tuning the pose of the robotic arm. After the scanning, the system could realize 3-D US reconstruction. Experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed system.

The establishment of a rigid-flexible coupling machine-hydraulic multibody dynamics model and an active compliance control algorithm for HHDM are the key problems to be solved urgently in the compliance control of heavy duty manipulators. In this paper, a multibody dynamics model of a machine-hydraulic system with seven degrees of freedom is developed with consideration of HHDM characteristics, such as multi-input multioutput, nonlinearity, and rigid-flexible coupling. Meanwhile, a position/force same loop control algorithm for the compliance control of HHDM is proposed based on genetic neural network. Specifically, the force control system is decomposed into subsystems, while the feedback position and force are output through the processing of the joint position controller, torque controller, and multibody dynamics model. Cosimulation results present the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed dynamics model and control algorithm. Moreover, the experimental environment and the HHDM control system are also developed, while the operation experiment of the control system for HHDM is accordingly conducted. Experiment results show that the control system can realize precise control of position and force, and can successfully complete the function of active compliance control operation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11

465	A Novel Combined Data-Driven Approach for Electricity Theft Detection	The two-way flow of information and energy is an important feature of the Energy Internet. Data analytics is a powerful tool in the information flow that aims to solve practical problems using data mining techniques. As the problem of electricity thefts via tampering with smart meters continues to increase, the abnormal behaviors of thefts become more diversified and more difficult to detect. Thus, a data analytics method for detecting various types of electricity thefts is required. However, the existing methods either require a labeled dataset or additional system information, which is difficult to obtain in reality or have poor detection accuracy. In this paper, we combine two novel data mining techniques to solve the problem. One technique is the maximum information coefficient (MIC), which can find the correlations between the nontechnical loss and a certain electricity behavior of the consumer. MIC can be used to precisely detect thefts that appear normal in shapes. The other technique is the clustering technique by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP). CFSFDP finds the abnormal users among thousands of load profiles, making it quite suitable for detecting electricity thefts with arbitrary shapes. Next, a framework for combining the advantages of the two techniques is proposed. Numerical experiments on the Irish smart meter dataset are conducted to show the good performance of the combined method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	133
466	Admittance Control Based on EMG-Driven Musculoskeletal Model Improves the Human-Robot Synchronization	The synchronization of output torque is an important issue during human-robot interaction. Since the human-robot synchronization may be affected by the delay between the human's voluntary torque and the robot's assistive torque when a torque sensor is applied to detect human intention, an electromyography (EMG)-based admittance controller (EAC) was proposed to improve human-robot synchronization compared with that achieved by the use of a torque-sensing-based admittance controller (TAC). Simulations and experiments were conducted to investigate the performance of the EAC and the TAC. The simulation results indicated that the delay between the human's voluntary torque and the exoskeleton robot's assistive torque significantly degraded the performance of the human-robot cooperation movement when the TAC was used. The experimental results indicated that the jerk value, interaction torque, and EMG level of the tibialis anterior obtained with the EAC were significantly smaller than those with the TAC. Compared with the TAC, the EAC has an advantage in improving human-robot cooperation movement because the EAC can reduce the delay between the human's voluntary torque and the exoskeleton robot's assistive torque. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	27
467	A Data-Driven Monitoring Scheme for Rotating Machinery Via Self-Comparison Approach	In the era of big data, a huge amount of monitoring and manufacturing data is generated every hour. As these data are typically measured from different machines and under different working regimes, prior information and domain knowledge are highly required in order to properly analyze and utilize these data. In view of this limitation, a data-driven self-comparison approach is proposed for the monitoring of rotating machinery. In this approach, comb filtering is introduced to extract the concerned signals from multisource background noise. A Gini-guided residual singular value decomposition is then proposed to enhance local anomalies induced by early defects. Finally, an iterative Mahalanobis distance is constructed to measure the statistical deviation of monitored component from a normal state. With the proposed method, health monitoring of rotating machinery could be achieved without prior information and domain knowledge, thereby providing an automatic data processing and condition monitoring tool in big data context. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	27
468	End-Effector Force Estimation for Flexible-Joint Robots with Global Friction Approximation Using Neural Networks	This paper proposes an improved disturbance observer to realize accurate contact force estimation using the joint torque sensor. The joint torque sensor separates the dynamics of the link side from the motor side of the robot manipulator. Therefore, only computing the partial dynamics on the link side can realize external force estimation. This can considerably reduce the modeling workload and error terms that may affect the estimation results. Furthermore, this paper presents that the observed residual value during free motion can be considered as the friction dynamics, which is approximated by the neural network (NN) due to its inherent capacity in approximating nonlinear functions. After that, the estimation accuracy of the observer is considerably improved. Compared to other local NN approximation method, we analyzes the properties of the friction force in detail to select appropriate excitation trajectory for accurate global approximation results using only limited training data. We have presented that the suitable excitation trajectory and the use of global basis function are the sufficient conditions for global friction approximation. The proof of this theorem is also given. The Kalman filter is also utilized to reduce the noise of the estimation results in real time. The experimental results also demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, which accurately estimates the contact force for flexible joint robots. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	40
469	Induction Motor Stator Current AM-FM Model and Demodulation Analysis for Planetary Gearbox Fault Diagnosis	Induction motor-planetary gearbox drivetrains are widely used for industrial productions, including machine tools in manufacturing systems. For fault diagnosis of planetary gearboxes in such electromechanical systems, motor current signal analysis provides an effective alternative approach, because motor current signals have easier accessibility and are free from time-varying transfer path effects. Planetary gearbox faults generate load torque oscillations, leading to both amplitude modulation and frequency modulation (AM-FM) effects on induction motor current signals. To thoroughly understand gear fault features in current signals, an AM-FM current signal model is derived through mechanical-magnetic-electric interaction analysis, explicit equation of Fourier spectrum is derived, and sidebands characteristics are summarized. To avoid an intricate sideband analysis, amplitude and frequency demodulation analyses are proposed, explicit equations of corresponding demodulated spectra are derived, and gear fault features are summarized. The theoretical derivations are validated through lab experiments. Localized fault on the sun, planet, and ring gears are all successfully diagnosed using the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
470	Distributed Real-Time IoT for Autonomous Vehicles	Real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications have stringent delay requirements when implemented over distributed sensing and communication networks in smart traffic control. They require the system to reach a permissible neighbourhood of an optimum solution with a tolerable delay. The performance of such applications mostly depends on the delay introduced by the underlying optimization algorithms, with the localized computational capability. In this paper, we study a smart traffic control scenario-a real-time IoT application, where a group of autonomous vehicles independently decide on their lane velocities, in collaboration with road-side units to efficiently utilize intersections with minimal environmental impact. We decompose this problem as an unconstrained network utility maximization problem. A consensus-based, constant step-size gradient descent algorithm is proposed to obtain a near-optimal solution. We analyze the delay-accuracy tradeoff in reaching a near-optimal velocity. Delay is measured in terms of the number of iterations required before the scheduling operation can be done for a particular tolerance. The operation of the algorithm under quantized message passing is also studied. On contrary to the existing methods to intersection management problems, our approach studies the limit at which an optimization algorithm fails to cater for the requirements of a real-time application and must fall back for a pareto-optimal solution, due to the communication constraints. We used simulation of urban mobility to incorporate the microscopic behavior of traffic flows to our simulations and compared our solution with traditional and state-of-the-art intersection management techniques. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	48
471	A Plane Projection Based Method for Base Frame Calibration of Cooperative Manipulators	Base frame calibration is the foundation for the cooperative work of manipulators. The commonly applied method usually constructed a matrix equation. The contact-mode approach is limited by the insufficient accuracy and efficiency while the high cost impedes the application of methods with the noncontact mode. In this paper, a projection-based method is proposed. All the transformation parameters can be solved based on the geometric constraints. When cooperative manipulators form the closed-chain asynchronously, the topological structure is projected into a particular plane. The rotation angle and translation parameters can be determined with utilization of trigonometric functions and a simple calculation process. The greatest novel feature of this analysis is that only two calibration points are required. The experiment result shows that both the accuracy and efficiency can be much better in the asynchronous calibration. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7

Since the wire sending status has impact on the wire tension, it needs to be controlled to be smooth enough first. The measurement of the wire sending state is based on the two tensometers near the wire sending point and the tension adjusting unit, respectively. The measuring principle is given in detail. The smooth wire sending control is realized through a position adjusting unit. To achieve good control performance, the wire sending state is divided into several sections, and a novel feedforward multiconditioned P controller is designed. After the smooth wire sending controller is designed, the factors related to the wire tension vibration are analyzed deeply, and then, a self-tuning fuzzy controller is proposed. The parameters of the controller can be tuned according to the wire moving velocity. To show the validity of the proposed method, experiments on real platform are well conducted. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

474	Fv-SVM-Based Wall-Thickness Error Decomposition for Adaptive Machining of Large Skin Parts	Large skin parts play an important role in the aerospace industry. The wall thickness of the machined pocket in the skin part needs to be strictly controlled to ensure the transport capacity and structural strength. The wall-thickness accuracy is generally decreased by various factors, such as the shaping error of the workpiece blank, fixing error, machine tool error, and deformation caused by cutting force or internal stress. These factors are usually inevitable and stochastic due to the extremely weak rigidity and easy-to-deflect characteristics of the large skin parts. To ensure the wall-thickness accuracy, a fuzzy v-support vector machine (Fv-SVM)-based wall-thickness error decomposition method is proposed. The wall-thickness errors, which are monitored in the cutting process, are decomposed into spatial-related errors and time-related errors. The Fv-SVM-based decomposition method with the principle of spatial statistical analysis is a data-driven approach for intelligent manufacturing. The data-driven method can consider all factors that affect the wall-thickness accuracy, while the model-driven method usually only considers one factor, such as the workpiece deformation or fixing error. After decomposition, the spatial-related wall-thickness error is offline compensated, and the time-related wall-thickness error is compensated by using a real-time strategy. The novel method can be applied to complex tool paths. The cutting experiment of rectangular pockets in a large skin panel was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The wall-thickness accuracy can be improved to 0.05 mm for the workpiece with only 2 mm thickness. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	17
475	Dexterous Grasping by Manipulability Selection for Mobile Manipulator with Visual Guidance	Industry 4.0 demands the heavy usage of robotic mobile manipulators with high autonomy and intelligence. The goal is to accomplish dexterous manipulation tasks without prior knowledge of the object status in unstructured environments. It is important for the mobile manipulator to recognize and detect the objects, determine manipulation pose, and adjust its pose in the workspace fast and accurately. In this research, we developed a stereo vision algorithm for the object pose estimation using point cloud data from multiple stereo vision systems. An improved iterative closest point algorithm method is developed for the pose estimation. With the pose input, algorithms and several criteria are studied for the robot to select and adjust its pose by maximizing its manipulability on a given manipulation task. The performance of each technical module and the complete robotic system is finally shown by the virtual robot in the simulator and real robot in experiments.

476	Online Energy Management for Multimode Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles	An online energy management controller is presented in this paper for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), which is based on driving conditions recognition and genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed controller can be used in the real-time application. First, the studied multimode PHEV is modeled and four traction operation modes are introduced in detail. Second, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is utilized to classify the real historical driving conditions data. Four types of driving conditions are constructed to describe the representative scenarios. Then, GA is applied to search the optimal values for seven control actions offline. These parameters for different driving conditions are preserved and can be activated online. Finally, the driving condition is identified online and the corresponding control actions are loaded and adopted. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is close to the globally optimal method, dynamic programming, and is superior to the charge-depleting/charge-sustaining technique. Also, hardware-in-the-loop experiment is built to validate the real-time characteristic of the proposed strategy. © 2018 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53
477	Multitask Policy Adversarial Learning for Human-Level Control with Large State Spaces	The sequential decision-making problem with large-scale state spaces is an important and challenging topic for multitask reinforcement learning (MTRL). Training near-optimality policies across tasks suffers from prior knowledge deficiency in discrete-time nonlinear environment, especially for continuous task variations, requiring scalability approaches to transfer prior knowledge among new tasks when considering large number of tasks. This paper proposes a multitask policy adversarial learning (MTPAL) method for learning a nonlinear feedback policy that generalizes across multiple tasks, making cognizance ability of robot much closer to human-level decision making. The key idea is to construct a parametrized policy model directly from large high-dimensional observations by deep function approximators, and then train optimal of sequential decision policy for each new task by an adversarial process, in which simultaneously two models are trained: a multitask policy generator transforms samples drawn from a prior distribution into samples from a complex data distribution with higher dimensionality, and a multitask policy discriminator decides whether the given sample is prior distribution from human-level empirically derived or from the generator. All the related human-level empirically derived are integrated into the sequential decision policy, transferring human-level policy at every layer in a deep policy network. Extensive experimental testing result of four different WeiChai Power manufacturing data sets shows that our approach can surpass human performance simultaneously from cart-pole to production assembly control. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
478	Deep Transfer Learning Based on Sparse Autoencoder for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Tool in Manufacturing	Deep learning with ability to feature learning and nonlinear function approximation has shown its effectiveness for machine fault prediction. While, how to transfer a deep network trained by historical failure data for prediction of a new object is rarely researched. In this paper, a deep transfer learning (DTL) network based on sparse autoencoder (SAE) is presented. In the DTL method, three transfer strategies, that is, weight transfer, transfer learning of hidden feature, and weight update, are used to transfer an SAE trained by historical failure data to a new object. By these strategies, prediction of the new object without supervised information for training is achieved. Moreover, the learned features by deep transfer network for the new object share joint and similar characteristic to that of historical failure data, which is beneficial to accurate prediction. Case study on remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of cutting tool is performed to validate effectiveness of the DTL method. An SAE network is first trained by run-to-failure data with RUL information of a cutting tool in an off-line process. The trained network is then transferred to a new tool under operation for on-line RUL prediction. The prediction result with high accuracy shows advantage of the DTL method for RUL prediction. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	226
479	Modeling and Planning for Dual-Objective Selective Disassembly Using and/or Graph and Discrete Artificial Bee Colony	Disassembly sequencing is important for remanufacturing and recycling used or discarded products. AND/OR graphs (AOGs) have been applied to describe practical disassembly problems by using 'AND' and 'OR' nodes. An AOG-based disassembly sequence planning problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Heuristic evolution methods can be adopted to handle it. While precedence and 'AND' relationship issues can be addressed, OR (exclusive OR) relations are not well addressed by the existing heuristic methods. Thus, an ineffective result may be obtained in practice. A conflict matrix is introduced to cope with the exclusive OR relation in an AOG graph. By using it together with precedence and succession matrices in the existing work, this work proposes an effective triple-phase adjustment method to produce feasible disassembly sequences based on an AOG graph. Energy consumption is adopted to evaluate the disassembly efficiency. Its use with the traditional economical criterion leads to a novel dual-objective optimization model such that disassembly profit is maximized and disassembly energy consumption is minimized. An improved artificial bee colony algorithm is developed to effectively generate a set of Pareto solutions for this dual-objective disassembly optimization problem. This methodology is employed to practical disassembly processes of two products to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. The results show that it is capable of rapidly generating satisfactory Pareto results and outperforms a well-known genetic algorithm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	149

481	3-D Deployment Optimization for Heterogeneous Wireless Directional Sensor Networks on Smart City	The development of smart cities and the emergence of three-dimensional (3-D) urban terrain data have introduced new requirements and issues to the research on the 3-D deployment of wireless sensor networks. We study the deployment issue of heterogeneous wireless directional sensor networks in 3-D smart cities. Traditionally, studies on the deployment problem of WSNs focus on omnidirectional sensors on a 2-D plane or in full 3-D space. Based on 3-D urban terrain data, we transform the deployment problem into a multiobjective optimization problem, in which objectives of Coverage, Connectivity Quality, and Lifetime, as well as the Connectivity and Reliability constraints, are simultaneously considered. A graph-based 3-D signal propagation model employing the line-of-sight concept is used to calculate the signal path loss. Novel distributed parallel multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are also proposed. For verification, real-world and artificial urban terrains are utilized. In comparison with other state-of-the-art MOEAs, the novel algorithms could more effectively and more efficiently address the deployment problem in terms of optimization performance and operation time. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	40
482	Recognition and Pose Estimation of Auto Parts for an Autonomous Spray Painting Robot	The autonomous operation of industrial robots with minimal human supervision has always been in high demand. To prepare the autonomous operation of a car part spray painting robot, novel object detection, and pose estimation algorithms have been developed in this paper. The object detection part used principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of three-dimensional (3-D) point cloud to 2-D binary image. Distance measure between the auto and cross correlation of the binary features was established to find out the similarity between them. Resultantly, the type of auto part was successfully obtained. Furthermore, iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm was used to estimate the pose difference of the auto part with respect to the camera reference frame, which was mounted on the robot. An issue with ICP's lack of robustness to local minimum was solved by the combination of ICP and genetic algorithm (GA). This allowed the optimization of pose error and addressed the problem of local minimum entrapment in ICP. For experimental validation: the proposed object recognition pipeline was implemented in both serial and parallel programming paradigms. The results were obtained for the acquired point clouds of side body car parts and compared with the major 3-D object detection systems in terms of computational cost. Pose estimation error was calculated with both ICP and the modified point set registration schemes, and it was shown to be decreasing in the case of later. All shown results supported the research claims. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
483	Impact of the Market Infrastructure on the Security of Smart Grids	We study the resiliency of demand response (DR) systems to data integrity attacks. In particular, we compare two popular proposals for DR: 1) a centralized direct load control system, and 2) a decentralized dynamic prices system. Through an economic analysis, we show that decentralized dynamic pricing systems are more resilient to attacks that try to defraud (or damage) the system. On the other hand, we show that this resiliency comes with a disadvantage for detecting attacks, as distinguishing attacks from system failures is harder in systems with dynamic prices. We also propose penalties for the users who benefit from an attack. The penalties depend on the estimated losses of victims and can discourage rational attackers from launching attacks in the first place. © 2018 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6

486	A blockchain-based nonrepudiation network computing service scheme for industrial iot	Emerging network computing technologies extend the functionalities of industrial IoT (IIoT) terminals. However, this promising service-provisioning scheme encounters problems in untrusted and distributed IIoT scenarios because malicious service providers or clients may deny service provisions or usage for their own interests. Traditional nonrepudiation solutions fade in IIoT environments due to requirements of trusted third parties or unacceptable overheads. Fortunately, the blockchain revolution facilitates innovative solutions. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based fair nonrepudiation service provisioning scheme for IIoT scenarios in which the blockchain is used as a service publisher and an evidence recorder. Each service is separately delivered via on-chain and off-chain channels with mandatory evidence submissions for nonrepudiation purpose. Moreover, a homomorphic-hash-based service verification method is designed that can function with mere on-chain evidence. And an impartial smart contract is implemented to resolve disputes.

494	Fog Computing for 5G Tactile Industrial Internet of Things: QoE-Aware Resource Allocation Model	Fifth generation mobile communication networks are currently being deployed, thus making Tactile Internet possible. Tactile Internet is the future advancement of the current Internet of Things (IoT) vision wherein haptics, or touch and senses, can be communicated from one geographical place to another, enabling near real-time control and navigation of remote objects. Tactile Internet will have its use cases in several application domains, with the industrial sector being among the most prominent ones. With the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Tactile Internet will be used in healthcare, manufacturing, mining, education, autonomous driving, etc. The acceptable delay in most of these tactile applications will be under one millisecond. Since Tactile Internet communicates haptics and gives visual feedback, quality of service (QoS) becomes an important issue. Similarly, user's satisfaction on the service quality [often measured as quality of experience (QoE)] becomes equally important. To reap the true potential of Tactile Internet, sophisticated and intelligent mechanisms are required between the end-nodes. A middleware such as fog computing can be vital in this context, since it can allocate resources based on the QoS/QoE requirements of each service. In this context, we present a QoE-aware model for dynamic resource allocation for tactile applications in IIoT. We implement the model using Java and discuss the empirical results to elaborate more on the impact of such a model for QoE-aware resource allocation that can be very important in the context of Tactile Internet, especially IIoT.

495	Combined data rate and energy management in harvesting enabled tactile IoT sensing devices	The Tactile Internet is envisioned to be characterized by ultra low latency, ultra reliability with high availability, and security. The next fifth generation is expected to underpin this emerging technology at the wireless edge. The stringent low latency and high reliability requirements of the Tactile Internet render the design more challenging in the presence of energy constraints on Internet of Things device in the underlying device-to-device network. In this paper, to deal with the stringent delay requirements of the tactile communication in the presence of energy constraints on devices and nodes, we pose the combined energy management and rate control problem as a queue control problem, where the objective is to control the energy and data queues to predefined reference levels. The intelligently controlled energy queues make the communication reliable and guarantee that nodes of the network are always alive and have some amount of energy close to predefined reference values for emergency and critical operations. In addition, tight control of the data queue ensures low queuing delays. We have considered both linear and nonlinear model of queues and have designed controllers based on model predictive control and nonlinear control theory.

However, it is still challenging to construct a 5G-enabled traffic management system, owing to the qualification of ultra-low latency and ubiquitous connectivity. Furthermore, the computing resources and storage capacities of edge nodes are limited, thus computation offloading is a fundamental issue for real-time traffic management.

Therefore, in this paper, we present the application of tactile Internet in healthcare by considering the diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as a use case, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Severe DKA causes Kussmaul breathing, which is a life-threatening condition that usually requires hospitalization. However, to date, no real-time monitoring system exists for DKA.

A peak detection algorithm is used to acquire the respiratory rate and extent, identified as normal breathing or Kussmaul breathing. The real-time respiratory rate and extent could be used to diagnose DKA in diabetic patients. The accuracy for all the subjects are 99.76%, 98.69%, 97.82%, 99.06%, and 98.42%, respectively; therefore, the reliability of the system is demonstrated. © 2019 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	44

A haptic feedback is inevitable for establishing a link between the operator and unknown in-body environment. However, haptic communications over the terahertz band may incur significant path loss due to molecular absorption. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for haptic communications over nanonetworks, in which in-body nanodevices transmit haptic information to an operator via the terahertz band. By considering the properties of the terahertz band, we employ Brownian motion to describe the mobility of the nanodevices and develop a time-variant terahertz channel model. Furthermore, based on the developed channel model, we construct a stochastic optimization problem for improving haptic communications under the constraints of system stability, energy consumption, and latency. To solve the formulated nonconvex stochastic problem, an improved time-varying particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented, which can deal with the constraints of the problem efficiently by reducing the convergence time significantly. The simulation results validate the theoretical analysis of the proposed system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25

It is illustrated that the proposed EED achieves better performance than the conventional ED in various transmission scenarios. Thanks to the above-mentioned advantages, the proposed EED-based FM-DCSK UWB system appears to be an excellent candidate for low-power and low-complexity tactile Internet-of-Things applications, e.g., wireless sensor networks and wireless body area networks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
504	Novel properties of successive minima and their applications to 5G tactile internet	The lattice L(A) of a full-column rank matrix A Rm×n is defined as the set of all the integer linear combinations of the column vectors of A. The successive minima λi(A),1≤ i≤ n, of lattice L(A) are important quantities since they have close relationships with the following problems: Shortest vector problem, shortest independent vector problem, and successive minima problem. These problems arise from many practical applications, such as communications and cryptography. This paper first investigates some properties of λi(A). Specifically, we develop lower and upper bounds on λi(A), where A are, respectively, the Cholesky factor of G1+G2 and (G1+G2)-1 for two given symmetric positive definitive matrices G1 and G2. The bounds are, respectively, expressed as the successive minima of L(A1) and L(A2), and L(A1) and L(A2), where A1, A2, A1 and A2 are, respectively, the Cholesky factors of G1, G2, G1-1, and G2-1. Then, we show how some properties of λi(A) are used to design a suboptimal integer-forcing strategy for cloud radio access network. Our approach provides much higher time efficiency while keeping the same achievable rate as the algorithm reported by Bakoury and Nazer (I. E. Bakoury and B. Nazer, 'Integer-forcing architectures for uplink cloud radio access networks,' in Proc. 55th Annu. Allerton Conf. Commun. Control Comput., Oct. 2007, pp. 67-75).

505	A secure FaBric blockchain-based data transmission technique for industrial internet-of-things	The previous blockchain data transmission techniques in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) have low security, high management cost of the trading center, and big difficulty in supervision. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure FaBric blockchain-based data transmission technique for industrial IoT. This technique uses the blockchain-based dynamic secret sharing mechanism. A reliable trading center is realized using the power blockchain sharing model, which can also share power trading books. The power data consensus mechanism and dynamic linked storage are designed to realize the secure matching of the power data transmission. Experiments show that the optimized FaBric power data storage and transmission has high security and reliability.

506	An Edge Intelligence Empowered Recommender System Enabling Cultural Heritage Applications	Recommender systems are increasingly playing an important role in our life, enabling users to find 'what they need' within large data collections and supporting a variety of applications, from e-commerce to e-tourism. In this paper, we present a Big Data architecture supporting typical cultural heritage applications. On the top of querying, browsing, and analyzing cultural contents coming from distributed and heterogeneous repositories, we propose a novel user-centered recommendation strategy for cultural items suggestion. Despite centralizing the processing operations within the cloud, the vision of edge intelligence has been exploited by having a mobile app (Smart Search Museum) to perform semantic searches and machine-learning-based inference so as to be capable of suggesting museums, together with other items of interest, to users when they are visiting a city, exploiting jointly recommendation techniques and edge artificial intelligence facilities.

507	A blockchain and automl approach for open and automated customer service	Customer service is transforming from traditional manual service toward automated service, which utilizes different computational informatics to achieve a higher efficient and quality services. Automated customer service requires big data and expertise in data analysis as prerequisites. However, many companies, especially small and medium enterprises, do not have sufficient data and experience due to their limited scale and resources. They need to rely on third parties, and this reliance results in the lack of development of core customer service competency. In order to overcome these challenges, an open and automated customer service platform based on Internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and automated machine learning (AutoML) is proposed. The data are gathered with the use of IoT devices during the customer service. An open but secured environment to achieve data trading is ensured by using blockchain. AutoML is adopted to automate the data analysis processes for reducing the reliance of costly experts. The proposed platform is analyzed through use case evaluation. A prototype system has also been developed and evaluated. The simulation results show that our platform is scalable and efficient. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	40
508	An Inductive Content-Augmented Network Embedding Model for Edge Artificial Intelligence	Real-time data processing applications demand dynamic resource provisioning and efficient service discovery, which is particularly challenging in resource-constraint edge computing environments. Network embedding techniques can potentially aid effective resource discovery services in edge environments, by achieving a proximity-preserving representation of the network resources. Most of the existing techniques of network embedding fail to capture accurate proximity information among the network nodes and further lack exploiting information beyond the second-order neighbourhood. This paper leverages artificial intelligence for network representation and proposes a deep learning model, named inductive content augmented network embedding (ICANE), which integrates the network structure and resource content attributes into a feature vector. Secondly, a hierarchical aggregation approach is introduced to explicitly learn the network representation through sampling the nodes and aggregating features from the higher-order neighbourhood. A semantic proximity search model is then designed to generate the top-k ranking of relevant nodes using the learned network representation. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the existing popular methods in terms of resource discovery and the query resolving performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
509	Computing resource trading for edge-cloud-assisted internet of things	Optimal computing resource allocation for edge-cloud-assisted Internet of things (IoT) in blockchain network is attracting increasing attention. Auction is a classical algorithm which guarantees that the computing resources are allocated to the buyers of the computing resource. However, the traditional auction algorithm only guarantees the revenue gains for the sellers of the computing resource. How to guarantee the seller and the buyer of the computing resource when both are willing to trade and moreover, bid truthfully, is still an open problem in computing resource trading for edge-cloud-assisted IoT. In this paper, we introduce a broker with sparse information to manage and adjust the trading market. We then propose an iterative double-sided auction scheme for computing resource trading, where the broker solves an allocation problem to determine how much computing resource is traded and designs a specific price rule to induce the buyers and sellers of the computing resource to submit bids in a truthful way. Thus, hidden information can be extracted gradually to obtain optimal computing resource allocation and trading prices. Hence, the proposed algorithm can achieve the maximum social welfare meanwhile protecting the privacies of the buyers and the sellers. Our theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient, i.e., it achieves the maximum social welfare. In addition, the proposed algorithm can provide effective trading strategies for the buyers and sellers of the computing resource, leading to the proposed algorithm satisfying incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	87
510	Long/short-term utility aware optimal selection of manufacturing service composition toward industrial internet platforms	As numerous Industrial Internet platforms emerge, manufacturing services are shared among multiple stakeholders more frequently than ever before. The optimal selection of shared manufacturing service composition (MSC) should promise both the task completion and the stakeholders' satisfaction. However, as commercial entities, stakeholders concentrate on not only the temporary benefits but also the long-term acquisitions. Most of the existing MSC problems neglect the stakeholders' prospect on the manufacturing service sharing. This leads to the disappointment and dissatisfaction of the stakeholders with long-term expectations, who will abandon the participation in Industrial Internet platforms. Therefore, the long/short-term preferences of various stakeholders should be satisfied and balanced. In this paper, the long/short-term utilities of three parties (provider, consumer, and operator) are first defined and discussed, and the models considering short-term utility of a consumer and long-term utility of providers are established. The potential tasks assigned to providers are taken into account to estimate the long-term utility if the current task is accepted. Then, to solve the biobjective optimization problem, an improved Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II algorithm, combining Tabu search and improved K-means mechanism, is proposed to find the optimal solution set. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by the experimental results in terms of solution diversity, astringency, and stability, in which a finding is further observed that the changes of consumers' preferences have little impact on the long-term utility of providers. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	27
511	Blockchain-empowered decentralized storage in air-to-ground industrial networks	Blockchain has created a revolution in digital networking by using distributed storage, cryptographic algorithms, and smart contracts. Many areas are benefiting from this technology, including data integrity and security, as well as authentication and authorization. Internet of Things (IoTs) networks often suffers from such security issues, which is slowing down wide-scale adoption. In this paper, we describe the employing of blockchain technology to construct a decentralized platform for storing and trading information in the air-to-ground IoT heterogeneous network. To allow both air and ground sensors to participate in the decentralized network, we design a mutual-benefit consensus process to create uneven equilibrium distributions of resources among the participants. We use a Cournot model to optimize the active density factor set in the heterogeneous air network and then employ a Nash equilibrium to balance the number of ground sensors, which is influenced by the achievable average downlink rate between the air sensors and the ground supporters. Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the beneficial properties of the proposed consensus process for air-to-ground networks and show the maximum active sensor's density utilization of air networks to achieve a high quality of service. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25
512	Bsis: Blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in vehicular energy network	Vehicular energy network (VEN), as an important part of the Internet of Things for the smart city, can facilitate the renewable energy (RE) transportation over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs) through wireless power transfer technology. However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs' utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	118
513	A blockchain-based solution for enhancing security and privacy in smart factory	Through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a smart factory has entered the booming period. However, as the number of nodes and network size become larger, the traditional IIoT architecture can no longer provide effective support for such enormous system. Therefore, we introduce the Blockchain architecture, which is an emerging scheme for constructing the distributed networks, to reshape the traditional IIoT architecture. First, the major problems of the traditional IIoT architecture are analyzed, and the existing improvements are summarized. Second, we introduce a security and privacy model to help design the Blockchain-based architecture. On this basis, we decompose and reorganize the original IIoT architecture to form a new multicenter partially decentralized architecture. Then, we introduce some relative security technologies to improve and optimize the new architecture. After that we design the data interaction process and the algorithms of the architecture. Finally, we use an automatic production platform to discuss the specific implementation. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture provides better security and privacy protection than the traditional architecture. Thus, the proposed architecture represents a significant improvement of the original architecture, which provides a new direction for the IIoT development. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	160
514	Active object detection with multistep action prediction using deep q-network	In recent years, great success has been achieved in visual object detection, which is one of the fundamental tasks in the field of industrial intelligence. Most of existing methods have been proposed to deal with single well-captured still images, while in practical robotic applications, due to nuisances, such as tiny scale, partial view, or occlusion, one still image may not contain enough information for object detection. However, an intelligent robot has the capability to adjust its viewpoint to get better images for detection. Therefore, active object detection becomes a very important perception strategy for intelligent robots. In this paper, by formulating active object detection as a sequential action decision process, a deep reinforcement learning framework is established to resolve it. Furthermore, a novel deep Q-learning network (DQN) with a dueling architecture is proposed, the network has two separate output channels, one predicts action type and the other predicts action range. By combining the two output channels, the action space is explored more efficiently. Several methods are extensively validated and the results show that the proposed one obtains the best results and predicts action in real time. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	36
515	Pnklmf-based neural network control and learning-based hc mppt technique for multiobjective grid integrated solar pv based distributed generating system	In this paper, a novel power normalized kernel least mean fourth algorithm based neural network (NN) control (PNKLMF-NN) technique and learning-based hill climbing (L-HC) maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm are proposed for grid-integrated solar photovoltaic (PV) system. Here three-phase single-stage topology of a grid-integrated PV system is used for feeding the nonlinear/linear load at the point of common coupling. A single layer neuron structure is used for active load component (ALC) extraction from distorted load current. During ALC extraction, PNKLMF-NN control very precisely attenuates harmonics components, noise, dc offset, bias, notches, and distortions from the nonlinear current, which improves the power quality under normal as well as under abnormal conditions. This single layer PNKLMF-NN control has a very simple architecture, which reduces the computational burden and complexity. Therefore, it is easy in implementation. Moreover, proposed L-HC is the improved form of hill climbing (HC) algorithm, where inherent problems of traditional HC algorithm, such as steady-state oscillation, slow dynamic responses, and fixed step size issues, are successfully mitigated. The prime objective of proposed PNKLMF-NN control is to meet the active power requirement of the loads from generated solar PV power and excess power fed into the grid. However, when generated PV power is less than the required load power, then PNKLMF-NN control meets the load by taking extra required power from the grid. During these processes, power quality is maintained at the grid. Moreover, when solar irradiation is zero, voltage source converter (VSC) acts as distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM), which enhances the utilization factor of the system. The proposed techniques are modeled and their performances are verified experimentally on a developed g prototype in adverse conditions, which test results have satisfied the objectives of the proposed system and the IEEE-519 standard. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	46
516	Performance optimization for blockchain-enabled industrial internet of things (iiot) systems: A deep reinforcement learning approach	Recent advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) provide plenty of opportunities for various industries. To address the security and efficiency issues of the massive IIoT data, blockchain is widely considered as a promising solution to enable data storing/processing/sharing in a secure and efficient way. To meet the high throughput requirement, this paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based performance optimization framework for blockchain-enabled IIoT systems, the goals of which are threefold: 1) providing a methodology for evaluating the system from the aspects of scalability, decentralization, latency, and security; 2) improving the scalability of the underlying blockchain without affecting the system's decentralization, latency, and security; and 3) designing a modulable blockchain for IIoT systems, where the block producers, consensus algorithm, block size, and block interval can be selected/adjusted using the DRL technique. Simulations results show that our proposed framework can effectively improve the performance of blockchain-enabled IIoT systems and well adapt to the dynamics of the IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	168
517	Building redactable consortium blockchain for industrial internet-of-things	Applying consortium blockchain as a trust layer for heterogeneous industrial Internet-of-Things devices is cost-effective. However, with an increase in computing power, some powerful attacks (e.g., the 51% attack) are inevitable and will cause severe consequences. Recent studies also confirm that anonymity and immutability of blockchain have been abused to facilitate black market trades, etc. To operate controllable blockchain for IIoT devices, it is necessary to rewrite blockchain history back to a normal state once the chain is breached. Ateniese et al. proposed redactable blockchain by using chameleon hash (CH) to replace traditional hash function, it allows blockchain history to be written when needed (EuroS&P 2017). However, we cannot apply this idea directly to IIoT without solving the following problems: (1) achieve a decentralized design of CH; (2) update the signatures accordingly to authenticate the redacted contents; (3) satisfy the low-computing need of the individual IIoT device. In this paper, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first threshold chameleon hash (TCH) and accountable-and-sanitizable chameleon signature (ASCS) schemes. Based on them, we build a redactable consortium blockchain which is efficient for IIoT devices to operate. It allows a group of authorized sensors to write and rewrite blockchain without causing any hard forks. Basically, TCH is the first TCH and ASCS is a public-key signature supporting file-level and block-level modifications of signatures without impairing authentications. Additionally, ASCS achieves accountability to avoid abuse of redaction. While security analysis validates our proposals, the simulation results show that redaction is acceptably efficient if it is executed at a small scale or if we adopt a coarse-grained redaction while sacrificing some securities. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	44
518	Trajectory clustering aided personalized driver intention prediction for intelligent vehicles	Early driver intention prediction plays a significant role in intelligent vehicles. Drivers exhibit various driving characteristics impairing the performance of conventional algorithms using all drivers' data indiscriminatingly. This paper develops a personalized driver intention prediction system at unsignalized T intersections by seamlessly integrating clustering and classification. Polynomial regression mixture (PRM) clustering and Akaike's information criterion are applied to individual drivers trajectories for learning in-depth driving behaviors. Then, various classifiers are evaluated to link low-level vehicle states to high-level driving behaviors. CART classifier with Bayesian optimization excels others in accuracy and computation. The proposed system is validated by a real-world driving dataset. Comparative experimental results indicate that PRM clustering can discover more in-depth driving behaviors than manually defined maneuver due to its fine ability in accounting for both spatial and temporal information; the proposed framework integrating PRM clustering and CART classification provides promising intention prediction performance and is adaptive to different drivers. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	30
519	Resource trading in blockchain-based industrial internet of things	Past few years have witnessed the compelling applications of the blockchain technique in our daily life ranging from the financial market to health care. Considering the integration of the blockchain technique and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain may act as a distributed ledger for beneficially establishing a decentralized autonomous trading platform for industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. However, the power and computation constraints prevent IoT devices from directly participating in this proof-of-work process. As a remedy, in this treatise, the cloud computing service is introduced into the blockchain platform for the sake of assisting to offload computational task from the IIoT network itself. In addition, we study the resource management and pricing problem between the cloud provider and miners. More explicitly, we model the interaction between the cloud provider and miners as a Stackelberg game, where the leader, i.e., cloud provider, makes the price first, and then miners act as the followers. Moreover, in order to find the Nash equilibrium of the proposed Stackelberg game, a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm is conceived for searching the near-optimal policy. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate our proposed algorithm in comparison to some state-of-the-art schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	135
520	Lightchain: A lightweight blockchain system for industrial internet of things	While the intersection of blockchain and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has received considerable research interest lately, the conflict between the high resource requirements of blockchain and the generally inadequate performance of IIoT devices has not been well tackled. On one hand, due to the introductions of mathematical concepts, including Public Key Infrastructure, Merkle Hash Tree, and Proof of Work (PoW), deploying blockchain demands huge computing power. On the other hand, full nodes should synchronize massive block data and deal with numerous transactions in peer-to-peer network, whose occupation of storage capacity and bandwidth makes IIoT devices difficult to afford. In this paper, we propose a lightweight blockchain system called LightChain, which is resource-efficient and suitable for power-constrained IIoT scenarios. Specifically, we present a green consensus mechanism named Synergistic Multiple Proof for stimulating the cooperation of IIoT devices, and a lightweight data structure called LightBlock to streamline broadcast content. Furthermore, we design a novel Unrelated Block Offloading Filter to avoid the unlimited growth of ledger without affecting blockchain's traceability. The extensive experiments demonstrate that LightChain can reduce the individual computational cost to 39.32% and speed up the block generation by up to 74.06%. In terms of storage and network usage, the reductions are 43.35% and 90.55%, respectively. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	143
521	A blockchain-enabled trustless crowd-intelligence ecosystem on mobile edge computing	Crowd intelligence tries to gather, process, infer, and ascertain massive useful information by utilizing the intelligence of crowds or distributed computers, which has great potential in Industrial Internet of Things. A crowd-intelligence ecosystem involves three stakeholders, namely the platform, workers (e.g., individuals, sensors, or processors), and task publisher. The stakeholders have no mutual trust but interest conflict, which means bad cooperation of them. Due to lack of trust, transferring raw data (e.g., pictures or video clips) between publisher and workers requires the remote platform center to serve as a relay node, which implies network congestion. First, we use a reward-penalty model to align the incentives of stakeholders. Then the predefined rules are implemented using blockchain smart contract on many edge servers (ES) of the mobile edge computing network, which together function as a trustless hybrid human-machine crowd-intelligence platform. As ES are near to workers and publisher, network congestion can be effectively improved. Further, we proved the existence of the only one strong Nash equilibrium, which can maximize the interests of involved ES and make the ecosystem bigger. Theoretical analysis and experiments validate the proposed method, respectively. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	78
522	Local electricity storage for blockchain-based energy trading in industrial internet of things	The peer-to-peer energy trading has been achieved among nodes in industrial Internet of Things. To establish a secure private market, some meaningful works propose the concept of the energy chain, where one block is added in a linear and chronological order once the trading pair of nodes (buyer and seller) has a valid transaction verified by data audit (e.g., a hash value). Since the buyer applies virtual coins from the credit bank to buy others' surplus energy, a considerable credit utility is obtained if all nodes are encouraged to meet local power loads out of self-interest. However, such frequent transactions have huge operational overhead, including a long chain maintaining many blocks and an expensive energy transportation cost between trading pairs. To solve these challenging issues, our method enables nodes to satisfy their power loads through local stored energy (self-sufficiency), before participating as sellers if they still have considerable surplus electricity. Without transactions made by some self-sufficient nodes, the operational overhead can be mitigated in a more secure environment. Taking the classic Internet of energy as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions, and it can achieve a good tradeoff between credit utility and operational overhead. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	52
523	Towards secure industrial iot: Blockchain system with credit-based consensus mechanism	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays an indispensable role for Industry 4.0, where people are committed to implement a general, scalable, and secure IIoT system to be adopted across various industries. However, existing IIoT systems are vulnerable to single point of failure and malicious attacks, which cannot provide stable services. Due to the resilience and security promise of blockchain, the idea of combining blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) gains considerable interest. However, blockchains are power-intensive and low-throughput, which are not suitable for power-constrained IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, we present a blockchain system with credit-based consensus mechanism for IIoT. We propose a credit-based proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism for IoT devices, which can guarantee system security and transaction efficiency simultaneously. In order to protect sensitive data confidentiality, we design a data authority management method to regulate the access to sensor data. In addition, our system is built based on directed acyclic graph -structured blockchains, which is more efficient than the Satoshi-style blockchain in performance. We implement the system on Raspberry Pi, and conduct a case study for the smart factory.

524	Blockchain-enabled data collection and sharing for industrial iot with deep reinforcement learning	With the rapid development of smart mobile terminals (MTs), various industrial Internet of things (IIoT) applications can fully leverage them to collect and share data for providing certain services. However, two key challenges still remain. One is how to achieve high-quality data collection with limited MT energy resource and sensing range. Another is how to ensure security when sharing and exchanging data among MTs, to prevent possible device failure, network communication failure, malicious users or attackers, etc. To this end, we propose a blockchain-enabled efficient data collection and secure sharing scheme combining Ethereum blockchain and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to create a reliable and safe environment. In this scheme, DRL is used to achieve the maximum amount of collected data, and the blockchain technology is used to ensure security and reliability of data sharing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide higher security level and stronger resistance to attack than a traditional database based data sharing scheme for different levels/types of attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	163
525	Anonymous reputation system for IIoT-enabled retail marketing atop PoS blockchain	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing the retail industry for manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers to improve operational efficiency and consumer experience. In IIoT-enabled retail marketing, reputation systems play a critical role to boost mutual trust among industrial entities and build consumer confidence. In this paper, we focus on reputation management in the consumer-retailer channel, where retailers can accumulate reputations from consumer feedbacks. To encourage consumers to post feedbacks without worrying about being tracked or retaliated, we propose an anonymous reputation system that preserves consumer identities and individual review confidentialities. To increase system transparency and reliability, we further exploit the tamper-proof nature and the distributed consensus mechanism of the blockchain technology. With system designs based on various cryptographic primitives and a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, our blockchain-based reputation system is more efficient to offer high levels of privacy guarantees compared with existing ones. Finally, we explore the implementation challenges of the blockchain-based architecture and present a proof-of-concept prototype system by Parity Ethereum.

526	TeMA: A Tensorial Memetic Algorithm for Many-Objective Parallel Disassembly Sequence Planning in Product Refurbishment	The refurbishment market is rich in opportunities-the global refurbished smartphones market alone will be $38.9 billion by 2025. Refurbishing a product involves disassembling it to test the key parts and replacing those that are defective or worn. This restores the product to like-new conditions, so that it can be put on the market again at a lower price. Making this process quick and efficient is crucial. This paper presents a novel formulation of parallel disassembly problem that maximizes the degree of parallelism, the level of ergonomics, and how the workers' workload is balanced, while minimizing the disassembly time and the number of times the product has to be rotated. The problem is solved using the Tensorial Memetic Algorithm (TeMA), a novel two-stage many-objective (MaO) algorithm, which encodes parallel disassembly plans by using third-order tensors. TeMA first splits the objectives into primary and secondary on the basis of a decision-maker's preferences, and then finds Pareto-optimal compromises (seeds) of the primary objectives. In the second stage, TeMA performs a fine-grained local search that explores the objective space regions around the seeds, to improve the secondary objectives. TeMA was tested on two real-world refurbishment processes involving a smartphone and a washing machine. The experiments showed that, on average, TeMA is statistically more accurate than various efficient MaO algorithms in the decision-maker's area of preference. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
527	A Differential-Private Framework for Urban Traffic Flows Estimation via Taxi Companies	Due to the prominent development of public transportation systems, the taxi flows could nowadays work as a reasonable reference to the trend of urban population. Being aware of this knowledge will significantly benefit regular individuals, city planners, and the taxi companies themselves. However, to mindlessly publish such contents will severely threaten the private information of taxi companies. Both their own market ratios and the sensitive information of passengers and drivers will be revealed. Consequently, we propose in this paper a novel framework for privacy-preserved traffic sharing among taxi companies, which jointly considers the privacy, profits, and fairness for participants. The framework allows companies to share scales of their taxi flows, and common knowledge will be derived from these statistics. Two algorithms are proposed for the derivation of sharing schemes in different scenarios, depending on whether the common knowledge can be accessed by third parties like individuals and governments. The differential privacy is utilized in both cases to preserve the sensitive information for taxi companies. Finally, both algorithms are validated on real-world data traces under multiple market distributions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	157
528	Planning and Operation of Isolated Microgrids Based on Repurposed Electric Vehicle Batteries	Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) can be very beneficial to power systems and microgrids for various applications. With increasing sales of electric vehicles (EV), the availability of used electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) is on the rise, which has received significant attention in recent years. The retired EVBs, after repurposing, can serve as an alternative option to new batteries in a BESS. In addition, when a microgrid operator desires to install a BESS, the optimal decisions such as installation year, energy and power size, replacement year, and the number of cycles to failure, that are normally overlooked, have to be determined. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive and novel framework for planning and operation of the BESS based on repurposed EVBs. A novel linearized BESS sizing model is proposed that obtains the BESS optimal decisions regarding design and operation. Various new, modified, and linearized relationships for the BESS have been included in the planning model to ensure that the replacement year of the BESS is optimally determined. Several classes of EVs with multiple drive cycles are clustered and integrated within the proposed framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25

530	Fog-Embedded Deep Learning for the Internet of Things	In current deep learning models, centralized architecture forces participants to pool their data to the central Cloud to train a global model, while distributed architecture requires a parameter server to mediate the training process. However, privacy issues, response delays, and computation and communication bottlenecks prevent these architectures from working well at the scale of Internet of Things devices. To counter these problems, in this paper we build a Fog-embedded privacy-preserving deep learning framework (FPPDL), which moves computation from the centralized Cloud to Fog nodes near the end devices. The experimental results on benchmark image datasets under different settings demonstrate that FPPDL achieves comparable accuracy to the centralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) framework, and delivers better accuracy than the standalone SGD framework. Our evaluations also show that both computation and communication cost are greatly reduced by FPPDL, hence achieving the desired tradeoff between privacy and performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	30
531	Optimal Positioning of Energy Assets in Autonomous Robotic Microgrids for Power Restoration	As the number of natural disasters and the duration of their aftermath continues to rise, the use of mobile and autonomous energy sources formed into a temporary and adaptive microgrid will improve response time and decrease overall recovery time. The optimal positioning of energy resources in the operating field is critical. There are many options for choosing an optimization technique but many of these assume specific connections between voltage source nodes and loads. This paper presents a brief overview of the genetic algorithm optimization in microgrid resource positioning in an operating field with obstacles. The indexing of the nodes and loads and the formulation for optimization of a general model of a microgrid system are presented. Next, the optimization of microgrids using the genetic algorithm approach is explained, as well as the shortest path algorithm used. The results show the success of optimization applied to a variety of test cases. Further research and expansions of optimization in the test cases are then explained. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
532	An Efficient Edge Artificial Intelligence MultiPedestrian Tracking Method with Rank Constraint	Characterized by the ability to handle varying number of objects, tracking by detection framework becomes increasingly popular in multiobject tracking (MOT) problem. However, the tracking performance heavily depends on the object detector. Considering that data association optimization and association affinity model are two key parts in MOT, an online multipedestrian tracking method is proposed to formulate a more effective association affinity model. It includes a two-step data association taking advantage of rank-based dynamic motion affinity model. The rank-based dynamic motion affinity model is used to estimate the object state and refine the trajectory for each of target to achieve the noiseless trajectory. Both strategies are beneficial to eliminate ambiguous detection responses during association. To fairly verify the proposed method, three public datasets are adopted. Both qualitative and quantitative experiment results demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed tracking algorithm in comparison with its counterparts. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
533	Securing Deep Learning Based Edge Finger Vein Biometrics with Binary Decision Diagram	With built-in artificial intelligence (AI), edge devices, e.g., smart cameras, can perform tasks like detecting and tracking individuals, which is referred to as edge biometrics. As a driving force for AI, machine/deep learning plays a critical role in edge biometrics. Machine/deep learning based edge biometric systems outperform their nonmachine learning counterpart. However, research shows that artificial neural networks, e.g., convolutional neural networks, are invertible such that adversaries can obtain a certain amount of information about the original inputs/templates. This information leakage is not tolerable for biometric systems because biometric data in the original (raw) templates cannot be reset or replaced. Once compromised, they are lost forever. Therefore, how to prevent original biometric templates from being attacked through inverting deep neural networks is a pressing, but unsolved issue, for deep learning based biometric recognition. To address the issue, in this paper, we develop a novel biometric template protection algorithm using the binary decision diagram (BDD) for deep learning based finger-vein biometric systems. The proposed algorithm is capable of creating a new noninvertible version of the original finger-vein template, which is stacked with an artificial neural network-the multilayer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) to generate a privacy-preserving finger-vein recognition system, named BDD-ML-ELM. The proposed BDD-ML-ELM ensures the safety of the original finger-vein template even if its transformed version is compromised. The transformed template, if compromised, can be revoked and replaced with another new version by simply changing the user-specific keys. Therefore, the BDD-ML-ELM has a clear advantage over the existing machine/deep learning based biometric systems, whose raw biometric templates are vulnerable when the artificial neural network suffers an inversion attack. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	35
534	Artificial Intelligence-Driven Mechanism for Edge Computing-Based Industrial Applications	Due to various challenging issues such as, computational complexity and more delay in cloud computing, edge computing has overtaken the conventional process by efficiently and fairly allocating the resources i.e., power and battery lifetime in Internet of things (IoT)-based industrial applications. In the meantime, intelligent and accurate resource management by artificial intelligence (AI) has become the center of attention especially in industrial applications. With the coordination of AI at the edge will remarkably enhance the range and computational speed of IoT-based devices in industries. But the challenging issue in these power hungry, short battery lifetime, and delay-intolerant portable devices is inappropriate and inefficient classical trends of fair resource allotment. Also, it is interpreted through extensive industrial datasets that dynamic wireless channel could not be supported by the typical power saving and battery lifetime techniques, for example, predictive transmission power control (TPC) and baseline. Thus, this paper proposes 1) a forward central dynamic and available approach (FCDAA) by adapting the running time of sensing and transmission processes in IoT-based portable devices; 2) a system-level battery model by evaluating the energy dissipation in IoT devices; and 3) a data reliability model for edge AI-based IoT devices over hybrid TPC and duty-cycle network. Two important cases, for instance, static (i.e., product processing) and dynamic (i.e., vibration and fault diagnosis) are introduced for proper monitoring of industrial platform. Experimental testbed reveals that the proposed FCDAA enhances energy efficiency and battery lifetime at acceptable reliability (∼0.95) by appropriately tuning duty cycle and TPC unlike conventional methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	165
535	MASM: A Multiple-Algorithm Service Model for Energy-Delay Optimization in Edge Artificial Intelligence	Edge computing has emerged as a promising technique because of its advantages in providing low-latency computation offloading services for resource-limited mobile user devices and Internet of Things applications. Computationally intensive artificial intelligence (AI) tasks are well suited to be offloaded to the Cloudlet server, but there is a lack of energy-delay optimization models specifically designed for this edge AI scenario. In this paper, we propose a multiple algorithm service model (MASM) that provides heterogeneous algorithms with different computation complexities and required data sizes to fulfill the same task, and develop an optimization model that aims at reducing the energy and delay cost by optimizing the workload assignment weights and computing capacities of virtual machines, at the same time guaranteeing the quality of the results (QoRs). We propose a tide ebb algorithm to solve the MASM optimization model, and we prove its Parato optimality. Numerical results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and prove that the energy and delay costs can be significantly reduced by sacrificing the QoR of the offloaded AI tasks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	64
536	Smart Manufacturing Scheduling with Edge Computing Using Multiclass Deep Q Network	Manufacturing is involved with complex job shop scheduling problems (JSP). In smart factories, edge computing supports computing resources at the edge of production in a distributed way to reduce response time of making production decisions. However, most works on JSP did not consider edge computing. Therefore, this paper proposes a smart manufacturing factory framework based on edge computing, and further investigates the JSP under such a framework. With recent success of some AI applications, the deep Q network (DQN), which combines deep learning and reinforcement learning, has showed its great computing power to solve complex problems. Therefore, we adjust the DQN with an edge computing framework to solve the JSP. Different from the classical DQN with only one decision, this paper extends the DQN to address the decisions of multiple edge devices. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs better than the other methods using only one dispatching rule. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	90
537	Multilayer Data-Driven Cyber-Attack Detection System for Industrial Control Systems Based on Network, System, and Process Data	The growing number of attacks against cyber-physical systems in recent years elevates the concern for cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs). The current efforts of ICS cybersecurity are mainly based on firewalls, data diodes, and other methods of intrusion prevention, which may not be sufficient for growing cyber threats from motivated attackers. To enhance the cybersecurity of ICS, a cyber-attack detection system built on the concept of defense-in-depth is developed utilizing network traffic data, host system data, and measured process parameters. This attack detection system provides multiple-layer defense in order to gain the defenders precious time before unrecoverable consequences occur in the physical system. The data used for demonstrating the proposed detection system are from a real-time ICS testbed. Five attacks, including man in the middle (MITM), denial of service (DoS), data exfiltration, data tampering, and false data injection, are carried out to simulate the consequences of cyber attack and generate data for building data-driven detection models. Four classical classification models based on network data and host system data are studied, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, bootstrap aggregating (bagging), and random forest (RF), to provide a secondary line of defense of cyber-attack detection in the event that the intrusion prevention layer fails. Intrusion detection results suggest that KNN, bagging, and RF have low missed alarm and false alarm rates for MITM and DoS attacks, providing accurate and reliable detection of these cyber attacks. Cyber attacks that may not be detectable by monitoring network and host system data, such as command tampering and false data injection attacks by an insider, are monitored for by traditional process monitoring protocols. In the proposed detection system, an auto-associative kernel regression model is studied to strengthen early attack detection. The result shows that this approach detects physically impactful cyber attacks before significant consequences occur. The proposed multiple-layer data-driven cyber-attack detection system utilizing network, system, and process data is a promising solution for safeguarding an ICS. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	133
538	A Time-Driven Data Placement Strategy for a Scientific Workflow Combining Edge Computing and Cloud Computing	Compared to traditional distributed computing environments such as grids, cloud computing provides a more cost-effective way to deploy scientific workflows. Each task of a scientific workflow requires several large datasets that are located in different datacenters, resulting in serious data transmission delays. Edge computing reduces the data transmission delays and supports the fixed storing manner for scientific workflow private datasets, but there is a bottleneck in its storage capacity. It is a challenge to combine the advantages of both edge computing and cloud computing to rationalize the data placement of scientific workflow, and optimize the data transmission time across different datacenters. In this study, a self-adaptive discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with genetic algorithm operators (GA-DPSO) was proposed to optimize the data transmission time when placing data for a scientific workflow. This approach considered the characteristics of data placement combining edge computing and cloud computing. In addition, it considered the factors impacting transmission delay, such as the bandwidth between datacenters, the number of edge datacenters, and the storage capacity of edge datacenters. The crossover and mutation operators of the genetic algorithm were adopted to avoid the premature convergence of traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm, which enhanced the diversity of population evolution and effectively reduced the data transmission time. The experimental results show that the data placement strategy based on GA-DPSO can effectively reduce the data transmission time during workflow execution combining edge computing and cloud computing. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	119
539	Copyright Protection for Holographic Video Using Spatiotemporal Consistent Embedding Strategy	The interest in a three-dimensional (3-D) holographic display is increasing daily because it can generate full depth cue without utilizing any special glasses. However, the content of 3-D holographic videos currently without any protection can be illegally distributed and maliciously manipulated. Therefore, there is an urgent need to protect the copyright of holographic videos against malicious copying. Since watermarking is an effective way to protect the ownership of holographic sequence, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal consistent embedding algorithm for the holographic video watermarking. Imperceptibility requirement in the holographic video watermarking is more challenging compared with static holograms because of the temporal dimension existing in videos. The embedding algorithm should not only consider spatially embedding strength for each frame of the video, but also take the temporal dimension into account in order to guarantee the visual quality of the moving object. Before embedding, to defend the imperceptibility of the watermark from the holographic moving object, the embedding parameters are evaluated by the salient object from the interframe and intraframe. Different from the previous video watermarking algorithm, in order to ensure the robustness, in our paper, instead of two-dimensional watermark, 3-D watermark converted data (QR code) are embedded in the cellular automata (CA) domains using 3-D CA filters. Finally, the QR codes can be extracted from the watermarked holographic frames, and the final 3-D watermark can be digitally reconstructed with different depths' cue using the computational integral imaging reconstruction algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to several methods in the literature, especially the robustness against additive noise and compression attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
540	Deep Learning Based on 1-D Ensemble Networks Using ECG for Real-Time User Recognition	The postmobile era will go beyond using individual smart devices and allow for user interaction by connecting various devices with sensing capabilities, such as smartphones, wearable devices, automobiles, and the Internet of Things. Wearable devices can continuously collect a variety of information on the users and their environment as the devices are worn in daily life. Because of this, real-time big data analysis technology is needed. This paper proposes a deep learning-based ensemble network model for improving the performance and overcoming the problems, which can occur on a single network. This model is designed so that the features produced by n number of single networks are combined and relearned. In addition, different parameter values are used on each single network, and the data used in the experiments are generated by the fiducial point method, which uses feature point detection, and the nonfiducial point method for periods of 1 sec and n sec. In the experiment results, in the case of fiducial point-based ECG signals, the ensemble network recognition performance shows a maximum of 0.8% higher accuracy than that of the single network. In the case of a 1 sec period nonfiducial point-based ECG signal, the ensemble network recognition performance is a minimum of 0.4% and a maximum of 1% higher than that of the single network. In the case of an n sec period, there is a maximum difference of 1.3%, and the proposed ensemble network shows better performance than the single network. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	29
541	Flexible FTIR spectral imaging enhancement for industrial robot infrared vision sensing	Infrared (IR) spectral imaging sensing is a powerful visual technique for industrial material recognition in robot vision systems. However, the imaging sensing data have issues of random noise and band overlap. Resolution enhancement is usually the first step in the preprocessing procedure of industrial robot vision sensing. In this article, we develop a resolution-enhancement algorithm with total variation (TV) constraints for the degraded Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectrum due to overlap and noise degradation in the robot vision sensing. The kernel function is calculated using the spectrometer imaging systems and Fourier optical theory. The proposed model not only can remove noises effectively but also can estimate the kernel function because of the adaptive TV as constraint regularization. This model is examined by a set of simulated FTIR spectra with the Poisson noises and a series of real FTIR spectra. The proposed model is compared with the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can split the overlap band effectively while the spectral structure details are retained satisfactorily. The enhanced high-resolution imaging spectrum data can raise the robot vision sensing accuracy in industrial intelligent systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	88

543	A Trust-Based Active Detection for Cyber-Physical Security in Industrial Environments	For the cyber-physical systems (CPS) in the smart industrial environments, a larger amount of smart sensor nodes, processors and actuators are deployed to sense information from physical world, which is vulnerable to be attacked because the nodes are deployed in unattended areas. Security is a pivotal issue for CPS, therefore, a trust-based active detection (TBAD) scheme is proposed for improving the reliability of collecting data packets and reducing the data redundancy. In TBAD scheme, the trust of the nodes is evaluated by the neighboring nodes and the evaluation results are added into the header of data packets. Thus, according to the reliability of data packets collected by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the trust of sensor nodes is evaluated by the UAV. In addition, the evaluation trust of nodes stored in the header of data packets will be detected when the UAV suspects the stored trust of sensor nodes. Then, the trust of corresponding sensor nodes is adjusted according to the detection results. The sensor nodes with higher trust are selected to form movement trajectory. A series of simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the scheme. The results illustrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the efficiency and security of data routing in CPS. © 2019 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	48
544	Neural-Blockchain-Based Ultrareliable Caching for Edge-Enabled UAV Networks	Mobile edge computing (MEC) reduces the computational distance between the source and the servers by fortifying near-user site evaluations of data for expedited communications, using caching. Caching provides ephemeral storage of data on designated servers for low-latency transmissions. However, with the network following a hierarchical layout, even the near-user site evaluations can be impacted by the overheads associated with maintaining a perpetual connection and other factors (e.g., those relating to the reliability of the underpinning network). Prior solutions study reliability as a factor of throughput, delays, jitters, or delivery ratio. However, with modern networks supporting high data rates, a current research trend is in ultrareliability. The latter is defined in terms of availability, connectivity, and survivability. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the ultrareliable communication in MEC. Specifically, in our setting, we use drones as on-demand nodes for efficient caching. While some existing solutions use cache-enabled drones, they generally focus only on the positioning problem rather than factors relating to ultrareliable communications. We present a novel neural-blockchain-based drone-caching approach, designed to ensure ultrareliability and provide a flat architecture (via blockchain). This neural-model fortifies an efficient transport mechanism, since blockchain maintains high reliability amongst the peers involved in the communications. The findings from the evaluation demonstrate that the proposed approach scores well in the following metrics: the probability of connectivity reaches 0.99; energy consumption is decreased by 60.34%; the maximum failure rate is affected by 13.0%; survivability is greater than 0.90; reliability reaches 1.0 even for a large set of users. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	56

546	A Distributed Position-Based Routing Algorithm in 3-D Wireless Industrial Internet of Things	Smart factory is a typical application scene of Internet of Things and wireless terminal devices naturally compose a three-dimensional (3-D) industrial wireless network. A primary requirement in the network is delivering packets from source node to destination node. Most geographic routing algorithms are designed for planar networks and they do not suit 3-D networks. In this paper, we extend a greedy perimeter stateless routing algorithm (GPSR) into three dimensions named GPSR-3D. In GPSR-3D, each node decides next hop of a packet by cooperating with only local neighbors and hence this algorithm is totally distributed. GPSR-3D comprises two packet forwarding patterns named greedy forwarding pattern (GFP) and surface forwarding pattern (SFP). In GFP, a node always sends the packet to a neighbor closest to destination and when it fails, SFP is employed for recovery. In SFP, we first divide the whole network space into a set of subspaces based on a novel 3-D geometric structure. Then, a parallel polyhedron traverse algorithm is proposed to recover local minima. A flowchart of GPSR-3D is given to clearly present the process of delivering a packet based on GFP and SFP. Simulation results show that GPSR-3D is of great reliability, energy efficiency and storage efficiency. Specifically, data transmission amount in GPSR-3D is about 67% and 71% to that of multihop Delaunay triangulation (MDT) and GDSTR-3D on average. Moreover, GPSR-3D performs much better than MDT and GDSTR-3D in terms of average storage cost and the average storage space in GPSR-3D is about 48% and 26% to that of MDT and GDSTR-3D, respectively. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5

548	Threshold-Free Physical Layer Authentication Based on Machine Learning for Industrial Wireless CPS	Wireless industrial cyber-physical systems are increasingly popular in critical manufacturing processes. These kinds of systems, besides high performance, require strong security and are constrained by low computational capabilities. Physical layer authentication (PHY-AUC) is a promising solution to meet these requirements. However, the existing threshold-based PHY-AUC methods only perform ideally in stationary scenarios. To improve the performance of PHY-AUC in mobile scenarios, this article proposes a novel threshold-free PHY-AUC method based on machine learning (ML), which replaces the traditional threshold-based decision-making with more adaptive classification based on ML. This article adopts channel matrices estimated by the wireless nodes as the authentication input and investigates the optimal dimension of the channel matrices to further improve the authentication accuracy without increasing too much computational burden. Extensive simulations are conducted based on a real industrial dataset, with the aim of tuning the authentication performance, then further field validations are performed in an industrial factory. The results from both the simulations and validations show that the proposed method significantly improves the authentication accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	37
549	District Partition-Based Data Collection Algorithm with Event Dynamic Competition in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks	The advent of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) has enhanced marine environmental monitoring, auxiliary navigation, and marine military defense. One of the core functions of UASNs is data collection. However, current underwater data collection schemes generally encounter problems such as high energy consumption and high latency. Furthermore, the application of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has contributed to more problems of task assignment and load balancing. This leads to significant failure in data collections and controlling of spontaneous emergencies. To address these problems, a district partition-based data collection algorithm with event dynamic competition in UASNs has been proposed. In this algorithm, the value of information of the packet determines the priority of its transmission to the cluster head. The navigation position of the mobile sink and the area under the responsibility of each AUV are determined by the spatial region division. The path of the AUV in the subregion is then planned using reinforcement learning. Subsequently, the dynamic competition of multiple AUVs is used to handle emergency tasks. The simulation demonstrates that our proposed algorithm significantly reduces energy consumption to guarantee load balancing while reducing end-to-end transmission delay. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	45
550	Soft Computing-Based EEG Classification by Optimal Feature Selection and Neural Networks	Brain computer interface translates electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into control commands so that paralyzed people can control assistive devices. This human thought translation is a very challenging process as EEG signals contain noise. For noise removal, a bandpass filter or a filter bank is used. However, these techniques also remove useful information from the signal. Furthermore, after feature extraction, there are such features which do not play any significant role in effective classification. Thus, soft computing-based EEG classification followed by extraction and then selection of optimal features can produce better results. In this paper, subband common spatial patterns using sequential backward floating selection is being proposed in order to classify motor-imagery-based EEG signals. The signal is decomposed into subband using a filter bank having overlapped frequency cutoffs. Linear discriminant analysis followed by common spatial pattern is applied to the output of each filter for features extraction. Then, sequential backward floating selection is applied for selection of optimal features to train radial basis function neural networks. Two different datasets have been used for evaluation of results, i.e., Open BCI dataset and EEG signals acquired by Emotiv Epoc. The proposed system shows an overall accuracy of 93.05% and 85.00% for both datasets, respectively. The results show that the proposed optimal feature selection and neural network-based classification approach with overlapped frequency bands is an effective method for EEG classification as compared to previous techniques. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	45

The social features of vehicles are extracted to establish the network model by constructing triangle motif structures to obtain primary neighbors with close relationships. Additionally, the connection probabilities of nodes based on the characteristics of vehicles and devices can be estimated, by which a content sharing partner discovery algorithm is proposed based on convolutional neural network. Finally, the experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of our method with respect to various aspects, such as message delivery ratio, average latency, and percentage of connected devices. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	57
553	Scalable Healthcare Assessment for Diabetic Patients Using Deep Learning on Multiple GPUS	The large-scale parallel computation that became available on the new generation of graphics processing units (GPUs) and on cloud-based services can be exploited for use in healthcare data analysis. Furthermore, computation workstations suited for deep learning are usually equipped with multiple GPUs allowing for workload distribution among multiple GPUs for larger datasets while exploiting parallelism in each GPU. In this paper, we utilize distributed and parallel computation techniques to efficiently analyze healthcare data using deep learning techniques. We demonstrate the scalability and computational benefits of this approach with a case study of longitudinal assessment of approximately 150 000 type 2 diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the fourth case of mortality worldwide with rising prevalence. T2DM leads to adverse events such as acute myocardial infarction, major amputations, and avoidable hospitalizations. This paper aims to establish a relation between laboratory and medical assessment variables with the occurrence of the aforementioned adverse events and its prediction using machine learning techniques. We use a raw database provided by Basque Health Service, Spain, to conduct this study. This database contains 150 156 patients diagnosed with T2DM, from whom 321 laboratory and medical assessment variables recorded over four years are available. Predictions of adverse events on T2DM patients using both classical machine learning and deep learning techniques were performed and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score as metrics. The best performance for the prediction of acute myocardial infarction is obtained by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) both balanced and weight models with an accuracy of 97%; hospital admission for avoidable causes best performance is obtained by LDA balanced and SVMs balanced both with an accuracy of 92%. For the prediction of the incidence of at least one adverse event, the model with the best performance is the recurrent neural network trained with a balanced dataset with an accuracy of 94.6%. The ability to perform and compare these experiments was possible through the use of a workstation with multi-GPUs. This setup allows for scalability to larger datasets. Such models are also cloud ready and can be deployed on similar architectures hosted on AWS for even larger datasets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25

555	Bidirectional Prediction-Based Underwater Data Collection Protocol for End-Edge-Cloud Orchestrated System	The proliferation of advanced underwater technology and the emergence of various cloud services promote the horizon of cloud-based underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN). Sending end data to cloud for analysis is becoming a prominent trend, driving cloud computing as an indispensable computing paradigm. However, UASN bears tremendous burdens with respect to data collection from end to cloud, such as large transmission power consumption and high delay, which makes it difficult to meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements by using cloud computing alone. To this end, a two-level bidirectional data prediction model for end-edge-cloud orchestration is proposed in this article. The mobility and computing ability of edge elements are exploited to analyze and collect data. Edge elements predict the future data based on historical information and trend to decrease acoustic communication. Moreover, a data collection protocol with mobile edge elements is designed. With this protocol, computing paradigms are shifted from centralized cloud to distributed edge, and the differentiated capability of heterogeneous devices is exploited. After extensive experiments, the results show that the data collection cost is dramatically decreased while the bandwidth utilization is increased, which is critical for underwater acoustic communication. The proposed method and protocol strike a good balance between data accuracy and energy consumption for the new end-edge-cloud orchestrated system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	65

In the future, a large number of integrated sensors that simultaneously collect multifeature data will be added to industrial SCS. However, the collected big data are not trustworthy due to the harsh environment of the sensor. If the data collected at the bottom networks are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, the query and data mining results will be inaccurate, which will seriously affect the judgment and feedback of the cloud. The traditional method of relying on sensor nodes for data cleaning is insufficient to deal with big data, whereas edge computing provides a good solution. In this article, a new data cleaning method is proposed based on the mobile edge node during data collection. An angle-based outlier detection method is applied at the edge node to obtain the training data of the cleaning model, which is then established through support vector machine. Besides, online learning is adopted for model optimization. Experimental results show that multidimensional data cleaning based on mobile edge nodes improves the efficiency of data cleaning while maintaining data reliability and integrity, and greatly reduces the bandwidth and energy consumption of the industrial SCS. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	116
557	Game Theoretical Analysis on Encrypted Cloud Data Deduplication	Duplicated data storage wastes memory resources and brings extra data-management load and cost to cloud service providers (CSPs). Various feasible schemes to deduplicate encrypted cloud data have been reported. However, their successful deployment in practice depends on whether all system players or stakeholders are willing to accept and execute them in a cooperative way, which was scarcely investigated in the previous literature. In this paper, we employ a noncooperative game to model the interactions in a client-side server-controlled deduplication scheme (S-DEDU) and construct an incentive mechanism based on payment discount to motivate its final acceptance. The experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate the individual rationality, incentive compatibility, profitability, and robustness of our incentive mechanism. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
558	Double-Spending with a Sybil Attack in the Bitcoin Decentralized Network	A double-spend attack is one of the major security issues in most blockchain systems, but it is difficult to successfully launch unless an adversary has massive computing power. In this paper, we introduce a new attack model that combines a double-spend attack with a Sybil attack in the Bitcoin network. We present analysis results that a double-spending attacker can make a block propagation delay by conducting Sybil attacks and increase the probability of winning the mining race, thus successfully launching the double-spend attack. We develop the probability of success of this new attack in mathematics forms and analyze this attack model from the perspective of economics. We present the attacker's break-even point in various situations and demonstrate the effect of the proposed attack. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	66
559	Fault-Tolerant Event Region Detection on Trajectory Pattern Extraction for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks	Poisonous pollutants produced in chemical, plastics, or nuclear power industry are easy to leak and result in a large-scale hazardous event region. Recently, industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are intended to provide situational awareness in industry site and thus hold the promise of profiling the event region. However, low-cost nodes in IWSNs are prone to fail due to prolonged exposure to harsh environment. This article targets the detection of hazardous event region for IWSNs with faulty nodes. A fault-tolerant event region detection algorithm named TPE-FTED is proposed to formulate faulty nodes identification as a trajectory pattern extraction problem. Through online learning of probabilistic model, each node characterizes the distribution of sensing values under different sensing states. A specific set of probabilistic models can be formed as a trajectory which indicates something special happens. Based on the implicit knowledge from generated trajectories, TPE-FTED conducts pattern matching and checks spatiotemporal constraint to identify the declaration of faulty nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that TPE-FTED achieves low false alarm rate as well as high detection accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	35
560	Finite-Time Fault Estimator Based Fault-Tolerance Control for a Surface Vehicle with Input Saturations	In this article, in the presence of unknown actuator faults, input saturations, and complete unknowns including both internal dynamics and external disturbances, exact trajectory-tracking problem of a surface vehicle (SV) is solved by creating a finite-time fault estimator based fault-tolerance control (FFE-FTC) scheme. By virtue of input saturations, smoothly saturated controls are separated from input nonlinearities including unknown faults, thereby leaving faults-mixed unknowns be exactly observed by a finite-time fault estimator (FFE). By defining an integral sliding-mode (ISM) manifold and deriving affine controls with unknown gains from smooth saturations, Nussbaum technique is deployed to synthesize a uniformly adaptive finite-time controller working in a large range outside input saturations. Within the close range where saturations are removed, an ISM-based nonsmooth controller with finite-time auxiliary compensation dynamics is devised to finely stick tracking errors to the origin. Intuitively, large- and close-range control actions are triggered by measuring the ISM error, thereby contributing to the entire FFE-FTC scheme, which achieves exact fault-tolerance and unknown rejection under input saturations. Lyapunov and nonsmooth syntheses prove that the closed-loop FFE-FTC system is globally finite-time stable. Simulation results and comparisons on a prototype SV demonstrate remarkable performance in terms of feasibly saturated controls and exact trajectory-tracking, simultaneously. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	75
561	Compressed Sensing Based Selective Encryption with Data Hiding Capability	This paper proposes a joint selective encryption and data hiding scheme based on compressed sensing (CS), with a focus to its application in secure imaging. Specifically, working with a semantic-secure stream cipher, we suggest to selectively encrypt the sign bits of the CS measurements during its quantization stage and insert the authentication information using a nonseparable histogram-shifting based data hiding scheme. The rationale behind the sign encryption is that CS measurements, when measured by random subspace projection, is random in nature and thus, from both theoretical and experimental points of view, the mean squared errors associated with authorized users and attackers are significant. Due to the indistinguishability of the output ciphertext and the nonlinearity of the CS decoder, it is robust, when comparing with the existing selective encryption system of multimedia data, against known error concealment attacks. When applied in imaging, we demonstrate that it could effectively degrade the visual quality level while saving the computation load by at least 90%. Moreover, we further show that a state-of-the-art data hiding system can be seamlessly incorporated into the sign encryption, thus allowing soft data authentication without heavy computation. The proposed scheme is expected to strengthen the security of applications in the field where both energy and privacy are the concerns, such as sensitive information protection for multimedia data in wireless sensor networks. © 2019 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	28
562	Big Data Analysis Based Network Behavior Insight of Cellular Networks for Industry 4.0 Applications	In this article, we propose a big data based analysis framework to analyze and extract network behaviors in cellular networks for Industry 4.0 applications from a big data perspective, using Hadoop, Hive, HBase, and so on. The data prehandling and traffic flow extraction approaches are presented to construct effective traffic matrices. Accordingly, we can capture network behaviors in cellular networks from a networkwide perspective. Although there have been a number of prior studies on cellular network usage, to the best of our knowledge, this article is a first study that characterizes network behaviors using the big data analytics to analyze a network big data of call detail records over a longer duration (five months), with more users (five million), more records (several hundred million lines) and nationwide coverage. The call pattern analysis and network behavior extraction approaches are designed to perform big data analysis and feature extractions. Then, the corresponding algorithms are proposed to characterize network behaviors, i.e., cellular call patterns and network resource usage. The detailed evaluation is proposed to validate our method. For example, we find that some unpopular calls can last longer time and thus consume more network resources. © 2019 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	148
563	Robust Image Hashing Based Efficient Authentication for Smart Industrial Environment	Due to large volume and high variability of editing tools, protecting multimedia contents, and ensuring their privacy and authenticity has become an increasingly important issue in cyber-physical security of industrial environments, especially industrial surveillance. The approaches authenticating images using their principle content emerge as popular authentication techniques in industrial video surveillance applications. But maintaining a good tradeoff between perceptual robustness and discriminations is the key research challenge in image hashing approaches. In this paper, a robust image hashing method is proposed for efficient authentication of keyframes extracted from surveillance video data. A novel feature extraction strategy is employed in the proposed image hashing approach for authentication by extracting two important features: The positions of rich and nonzero low edge blocks and the dominant discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of the corresponding rich edge blocks, keeping the computational cost at minimum. Extensive experiments conducted from different perspectives suggest that the proposed approach provides a trustworthy and secure way of multimedia data transmission over surveillance networks. Further, the results vindicate the suitability of our proposal for real-time authentication and embedded security in smart industrial applications compared to state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	28
564	Fringe Pattern Improvement and Super-Resolution Using Deep Learning in Digital Holography	Digital holographic imaging is a powerful technique that can provide wavefront information of a three-dimensional object for biological and industrial applications. However, due to the constraint and cost of imaging sensors, the acquired digital hologram is limited in terms of pixel count, thus affecting the resolution in holographic reconstruction. To overcome this constraint, in this paper we propose a deep learning-based method to super-resolve holograms and to improve the quality of low-resolution holograms by training a convolutional neural network with large-scale data for resolution enhancement. Moreover, this algorithm can be broadly adapted to enhance the space-bandwidth product of a holographic imaging system without the need of any advanced hardware. We experimentally validate its capability using a lens-free off-axis holographic system, and compare the performance of various loss functions and interpolation methods in training such a network. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	38
565	Nonlinear noncausal optimal control of wave energy converters via approximate dynamic programming	This article proposes a novel nonlinear receding horizon optimal control algorithm for wave energy converter (WECs) with nonlinear dynamics. It is well accepted that the WEC control problem is essentially a noncausal constrained optimal control problem, where the energy output can be improved by incorporating the short-term wave prediction into the control synthesis. Inspired by this fact, we suggest a new nonlinear noncausal optimal control (NNOC) for WECs based on the principle of approximate dynamic programming, which can, first, explicitly use the wave prediction to improve the energy conversion efficiency; second, handle the state and control input constraints; third, reduce the computational burden. Different to the existing linear noncausal optimal control, the derived Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for NNOC does not have an analytic solution. To tackle this problem, a critic neural network (NN) is adopted to approximate its solution in a receding horizon manor. The weights of NN are determined via a policy iteration algorithm. The resulting NNOC consists of a causal state feedback part and a noncausal feedforward part to explicit incorporate wave prediction information. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the efficacy of the proposed NNOC method. 1551-3203 © 2019 IEEE.

567	A Data-Driven Power Management Strategy for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles including Optimal Battery Depth of Discharging	For hybrid electric vehicles, higher depth of discharge (DOD) indicates more use of battery energy, which can supply more inexpensive propulsions than the fossil fuel but accelerate the battery aging, thus leading to the increase in the equivalent battery life loss cost (EBLLC) related to battery aging. While developing an energy management strategy considering the battery aging effect for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), a tradeoff between energy consumption cost (ECC) and EBLLC should be made to identify the optimal DOD and minimize the total cost (TC). Furthermore, the optimal DOD is changeable with the initial state of charge (SOC) level. To develop a robust controller to deal with varying initial SOCs for PHEVs, this paper proposes a data-driven method, namely, a three-layer artificial neural network (ANN) to realize real-time power distribution including battery life model. Real-world speed profiles and Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) are leveraged to identify the optimal DODs and generate the neural network training data based on cases with a range of initial SOCs. The results clearly demonstrate the robustness of the proposed ANN and also indicate that the data-driven method can effectively reduce the total of ECC and EBLLC compared to typical optimization algorithms without a battery aging model, including the dynamic programming, PMP, and the rule-based strategy. In particular, the ANN can reduce the TC by 19.99%, 25.97%, and 33.13%, respectively, for cases with the initial SOC of 0.95, 0.85, and 0.65, compared to the rule-based method. And the TC of the ANN is comparable to the PMP including the battery degradation model. Moreover, the training sample scale on forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency of the ANN is evaluated. Finally, the computational time of these methods is comprehensively discussed to evaluate the time efficiency of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24
568	Resilient RMPC for Cyber-Physical Systems with Polytopic Uncertainties and State Saturation under TOD Scheduling: An ADT Approach	This article presents a resilient robust model predictive control (RMPC) strategy for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with polytopic uncertainties and state saturation nonlinearities under the try-once-discard (TOD) scheduling. To reduce the transmission burden, a so-called TOD protocol is adopted to schedule the nodes. The objective of the addressed problem is to design a set of resilient RMPC controllers such that, in the simultaneous presence of polytopic uncertainties and state saturations under the TOD protocol, the resilience, robustness, and exponential stability are guaranteed for the underlying CPSs. With the help of TOD-dependent Lyapunov-like function, and the average dwell-time (ADT) approach, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the proposed resilient RMPC approach and the exponential stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, two examples including a high-purity distillation process and a numerical simulation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
569	Front-End Parameter Monitoring Method Based on Two-Layer Adaptive Differential Evolution for SS-Compensated Wireless Power Transfer Systems	In this paper, a two-layer adaptive differential evolution (ADE) algorithm is adopted to monitor the parameters of the receiving resonators and the mutual inductances of series-series (SS)-compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. By only measuring the primary coils' voltages and currents, the proposed monitoring method can be applied for multiple-coil SS-compensated WPT systems without any feedback signals from the receivers. Compared to the conventional monitoring method based on the genetic algorithm (GA), which may find local optimal solutions by the manually tuned parameters of the mutation rate, the crossover rate, and the generations, the proposed method based on the two-layer ADE can always find global optimal solutions by the automatically tuned parameters of the differential weight, the crossover rate, and the generations. Experimental results validate that the ADE and the proposed two-layer ADE can monitor the parameters of both two-and three-coil SS-compensated WPT systems more steadily and accurately than the conventional GA. Additionally, the proposed two-layer ADE is verified to monitor the parameters of three-coil SS-compensated WPT systems with three different arrangements more accurately than the ADE. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24
570	Trajectory Tracking Control of AUVs via Adaptive Fast Nonsingular Integral Terminal Sliding Mode Control	This article aims to develop an effective control method that can improve the convergence rate over the existing adaptive nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode control (ANITSMC) method for the trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To achieve this goal, an adaptive fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode control (AFNITSMC) method is proposed. First, considering that the existing nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode (NITSM) has slow convergence rate in the region far from the equilibrium point, a fast NITSM (FNITSM) is proposed, which guarantees fast transient convergence both at a distance from and at a close range of the equilibrium point, and therefore increases the convergence rate over the existing NITSM. Then, using this FNITSM and adaptive technique, an AFNITSMC method is designed for AUVs. It yields local finite-time convergence of the velocity tracking errors to zero and then local exponential convergence of the position tracking errors to zero, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the upper bounds of the uncertainties and disturbances. Compared with the existing ANITSMC method, the salient feature of the proposed AFNITSMC method is that it provides AUV dynamics a faster convergence rate. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed AFNITSMC method and its superiority over the existing ANITSMC method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	127
571	Nei-TTE: Intelligent Traffic Time Estimation Based on Fine-Grained Time Derivation of Road Segments for Smart City	With the development of the Internet of Things and big data technology, the intelligent transportation system is becoming the main development direction of future transportation systems. The time required for a given trajectory in a transportation system can be accurately estimated using the trajectory data of the taxis in a city. This is a very challenging task. Although historical data have been used in existing research, excessive use of trajectory information in historical data or inaccurate neighbor trajectory information does not allow for a better prediction accuracy of the query trajectory. In this article, we propose a deep learning method based on neighbors for travel time estimation (TTE), called the Nei-TTE method. We divide the entire trajectory into multiple disjoint segments and use the historical trajectory data approximated at the time level. Our model captures the characteristics of each segment and utilizes the trajectory characteristics of adjacent segments as the road network topology and speed interact. We use velocity features to effectively represent adjacent segment structures. The experiments on the Porto dataset show that the experimental results of our model are significantly better than those of the existing models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	84

575	Cost-Driven Off-Loading for DNN-Based Applications over Cloud, Edge, and End Devices	Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved a great success in various applications. Traditional deployment for DNNs in the cloud may incur a prohibitively serious delay in transferring input data from the end devices to the cloud. To address this problem, the hybrid computing environments, consisting of the cloud, edge, and end devices, are adopted to offload DNN layers by combining the larger layers (more amount of data) in the cloud and the smaller layers (less amount of data) at the edge and end devices. A key issue in hybrid computing environments is how to minimize the system cost while accomplishing the offloaded layers with their deadline constraints. In this article, a self-Adaptive discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using the genetic algorithm (GA) operators is proposed to reduce the system cost caused by data transmission and layer execution. This approach considers the characteristics of DNNs partitioning and layers off-loading over the cloud, edge, and end devices. The mutation operator and crossover operator of GA are adopted to avert the premature convergence of PSO, which distinctly reduces the system cost through enhanced population diversity of PSO. The proposed off-loading strategy is compared with benchmark solutions, and the results show that our strategy can effectively reduce the system cost of off-loading for DNN-based applications over the cloud, edge and end devices relative to the benchmarks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	68

Real-time data from agriculture sensors can provide decision supports to improve the yields and quality of agricultural products, but also bring about challenges one of which is how to mine useful information from these vast amounts of data at acceptable computation costs. To deal with the dimension disaster problem faced by most conventional mining algorithms, in this paper we combine granulation techniques and genetic algorithm (GA) with a support vector machine (SVM) to propose a granular GA-SVM. In the integrated predictor, three granulation methods, that is, Min-Median-Max granulation, Quartile-Median granulation, and fuzzy granulation, are introduced to break down big data in agricultural cyber-physical systems into small-scale granules, and GA is used to find the optimal values of SVM penalty parameter and kernel parameter from the reduced granules. Internet of Things (IoT) data from Luochuan Apple Experimental Demonstration Station in Shaanxi Province, China, verified that the proposed granular GA-SVM predictor is effective to make big data prediction with reduced computation time and equivalent accuracy.

This paper develops a novel unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with the generalized correntropy loss (GCL) (termed as GCL-UKF) to estimate power system state with forecasting aid. The GCL is used to replace the mean square error loss in the original UKF framework. The advantage of such an approach is that it combines the strength of the GCL developed in robust information theoretic learning for addressing the non-Gaussian interference and the strength of the UKF in handling strong model nonlinearities. In addition, we take into account the nontrivial influences of the bad data for the innovation vector. An enhanced GCL-UKF method is established by introducing an exponential function of the innovation vector to adjust a covariance matrix so as to improve the GCL-UKF-based state estimation accuracy under the change of gain matrix caused by bad factors. Numerical simulation results carried out on IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, and 57-bus test systems validate the efficacy of the proposed methods for state estimation under various types of measurement. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	35

581	Disturbance Rejection through Adaptive Frequency Estimation Observer for Wind-Solar Integrated AC Microgrid	The renewable energy generation is the cornerstone component of the greener and cleaner ac microgrid. The high penetration of wind and solar photovoltaic energy sources in the distribution network causes unbalanced voltages, voltage rise, flicker, and internal and external uncertainties leading to disturbance and unreliable operation of the system. This paper presents the performance enhancement of the wind-solar integrated ac microgrid by implementing the adaptive frequency estimation observer (AFEO) aiming for disturbance rejection. The model uncertainties and unknown disturbances are taken care of by nonlinear active disturbance rejection controller based phase-locked loop in conjunction with the AFEO. No detailed mathematical model is required, instead the controller provides decent anti-interference and effortless parameter tuning. The fluctuations in power, interharmonics, current harmonics, and power quality (PQ) issues produced by wind and solar energy resource permeation into the grid, are addressed and mitigated by successful implementation of the AFEO for switching the grid side voltage source converter. The machine side converter obtains its switching pulses from vector control scheme. The encoderless speed and rotor position estimation of the synchronous generator (SG) driven by wind turbine is carried out by back electromotive force technique. The environmental variation of the wind and solar energy are overcome by utilizing perturb and observe scheme for optimal power extraction. Test results are obtained from the laboratory prototype under steady state and dynamic conditions including environmental changes, i.e., intermittent wind speed, solar insolation, and variable load conditions.

582	Review on Feature Extraction for 3-D Incoherent Image Processing Using Optical Scanning Holography	The advancement of digital holography in the past two decades has enabled precise capturing of three-dimensional (3-D) images of physical objects. This important technology has been widely applied in numerous industrial sectors such as, but not limited to remote sensing, metrology, biomedical imaging, advertising, and entertainment. Most of the hologram acquisition techniques developed to date is employing digital cameras for recording the hologram, hence imposing rigid restrictions on the size and resolution of the captured 3-D image. This limitation, however, is not found in optical scanning holography (OSH). Based on a scanning mechanism and a single pixel sensor, OSH is capable of capturing digital holograms of both macroscopic and microscopic, as well as fluorescent objects with high precision. Since its invention in the late 70s, numerous research works have been conducted to enhance this technology, optimizing important factors such as acquisition speed, precision, data size, and security. The objective of this article is to provide a walkthrough of the state-of-the-art of the OSH technology, from its original principle, to different variants that have been developed over the years with emphasis on their feature extraction capabilities under the incoherent mode of operation.

584	Real-Time Adaptive Parameter Estimation for a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell	In this paper, we propose real-time adaptive parameter estimation methods for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to facilitate the modeling and the subsequent control synthesis. Specifically, the electrochemical model of this fuel cell is in a nonlinearly parametric formulation. Hence, most of existing parameter estimation techniques for PEMFC mainly rely on the optimization approaches, requiring heavy computational costs or even offline implementation. In comparison to those methods, real-time adaptive parameter estimation methods for nonlinearly parametric system are developed in this paper. First, the nonlinearly parametric function is linearized by using the Taylor series expansion. Then, adaptive parameter estimation methods are proposed for estimating the constant or time-varying parameters of PEMFC. Different from the well-recognized adaptive parameter estimation methods, the proposed adaptive laws are driven by the extracted estimation errors, so that exponential convergence of the parameter estimation error can be guaranteed, without using any predictors or observers. Finally, practical experiments in a H-100 PEMFC system are conducted, which illustrate satisfactory performances of the presented parameter estimation methods under different operation scenarios. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22
585	Stand-Alone Brushless Doubly Fed Generation Control System with Feedforward Parameters Identification	Due to the low maintenance cost and high reliability, brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG) has great potential in remote stand-alone applications. For good dynamic performance, the feedforward compensation is used in the BDFIG system. However, its performance highly depends on machine parameters and rotor angle, and thus complicated parameter measurements or estimations are required. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive control system, in which the required feedforward parameters such as compensation coefficients and the transformation angle can be identified online by fully utilizing the control action of the inner loops. With the proposed system, precise machine parameters are needless and the encoder can also be canceled, and therefore the overall system becomes more cost-efficient and robust. Detailed analysis and designs of the adaptive control and identification are given in this paper. Experimental results from a BDFIG prototype prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
586	Stability Improvement Methods of the Adaptive Full-Order Observer for Sensorless Induction Motor Drive-Comparative Study	The adaptive full-order observer (AFO) is the most popular speed estimator for the induction motor (IM) drives. Therefore, due to its instability in the regenerating mode a few stabilization methods have been proposed in the literature. However, there is a lack of fair comparison of all advantages and drawbacks of these proposals. Thus, in this article, the classical AFO and its all known stabilization methods are compared with a recent new proposal, which is based on the introduction of an auxiliary adaptive variable in the observer state matrix. The stability analysis of this new proposal is presented in details in this article. The generalized AFO model containing all possible stabilization methods is formulated and stability analysis methods for each proposed solution are discussed and proved by simulation and experimental tests. Also the behavior of these modified AFOs in the open-and closed-loop sensorless IM vector control structure is presented and evaluated. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18

588	Cyber-Physical Security Design in Multimedia Data Cache Resource Allocation for Industrial Networks	For cyber-physical industrial networks, more and more multimedia data is faced in high-speed information transmission. The explosive data brings more challenges to the architecture of modern industrial networks. In this way, cache resource allocation technology is necessary for practical applications. In order to design reasonable caching framework, how to predict the multimedia data request is an important issue. In order to keep efficient and reliable data transmission in wireless industrial networks, security design is also critical for existing cache resource allocation. Based on previous works, some promising technologies have been applied, such as heterogeneous ultradense networks, wireless edge caching, and web content popularity prediction. In this paper, we summarize these promising technologies and provide a useful guidance for security design in cyber-physical cache resource allocation system. Specially, we can divide the proposed method into three main steps. First of all, a spatio-temporal multimedia content prediction based on long short-term memory is proposed for accurate prediction on multimedia data request. After that, we make use of Zipf fitting for caching model. At last, the caching optimization considering security is put forward in this paper. Experimental results show the satisfied performance of our proposed algorithm and it has obvious potential application value in cyber-physical industrial networks with cache resource allocation technology. © 2019 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
589	Speckle Reduction for Holographic Display Using Optical Path Difference and Random Phase Generator	In this paper, we present a concept for speckle reduction using optical superposition instead of temporal superposition. The proposed speckle reduction method does not contain any mechanical movement nor time-multiplexing technique. Therefore, the system is stable and free from the frame rate degradation or additional computation load. In addition, the angle diversity method is adopted with the proposed method to intensify the speckle reduction. In order to apply the angle diversity method, the required minimum angle difference is analyzed theoretically. To realize the proposed speckle reduction concept, the system is implemented with practical optical components. The system includes an echelon, which is a stair-shaped glass and a static diffuser. The echelon is employed to decrease the spatial coherence of the incident beam. The static diffuser imposes the band-limited random phases on each of the split beams that have passed through the echelon. Also, the static diffuser is used to combine mutually incoherent split beams into a single speckle-reduced beam. The proposed speckle-reduced light source is applied to the holographic display to demonstrate the speckle reduction effect. Experimental results show that the speckle contrast of the reconstructed image is reduced by 55%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
590	Offline Inductance Identification of IPMSM with Sequence-Pulse Injection	Identification of the stator d-axis and q-axis inductances is essential for the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) sensorless control system. The signal injection method is an effective way to identify the inductance parameters; however, it requires the rotor position to ensure the accuracy of the injection reference position. To overcome the dependence on the rotor position, a sequence-pulse voltage signal injection method is presented. The matrix least-squares fitting algorithm is utilized to fit the current responses for the inductance identification. Based on the fitting method, the discrete standard orthogonal polynomial with look-up table is introduced to reduce the computation complexity. To reduce the disturbance of the injected signal to the rotor position during the identification process, a double-direction injection position trajectory planning is presented. In addition, the saturation effect on the identification method is also analyzed. The proposed method is verified via a 3.0 kW IPMSM motor drive platform. The identification results are compared with those measured by a standard method and experiment results show that the proposed method can identify the inductance parameters with acceptable accuracy without obtaining the rotor position information. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15
591	An Efficient Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme with Policy Update and File Update in Cloud Computing	Recently, more and more users and enterprises have entrusted data storage and platform construction to proxy cloud service provider (PCSP) through cloud technology. Under this background, the attribute-based encryption (ABE) mechanism is an alternative to fill the drawbacks of the traditional encryption through flexible fine-grained access policy and collusion prevention. However, there exist some security issues when the access policy and file need to be updated in practical applications. And the ABE has the problems of excessive computation and storage costs. In this article, an efficient ciphertext-policy ABE scheme with policy update and file update is proposed in cloud computing. The ciphertext components generated by first encryption can be shared when the policy update and file update happens. It reduces the storage and communication costs of the client, and the computational cost of the PCSP. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proved to be secure under the assumption of decision q-parallel bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent (BDHE). Finally, experimental simulation shows that the proposed scheme is highly efficient in terms of policy update and file update. © 2019 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	41
592	Vulnerable Code Clone Detection for Operating System through Correlation-Induced Learning	Vulnerable code clones in the operating system (OS) threaten the safety of smart industrial environment, and most vulnerable OS code clone detection approaches neglect correlations between functions that limits the detection effectiveness. In this article, we propose a two-phase framework to find vulnerable OS code clones by learning on correlations between functions. On the training phase, functions as the training set are extracted from the latest code repository and function features are derived by their AST structure. Then, external and internal correlations are explored by graph modeling of functions. Finally, the graph convolutional network for code clone detection (GCN-CC) is trained using function features and correlations. On the detection phase, functions in the to-be-detected OS code repository are extracted and the vulnerable OS code clones are detected by the trained GCN-CC. We conduct experiments on five real OS code repositories, and experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5

594	Identification and Control of Electric Elasticity Limit for Electric-Spring-Based Flexible Loads	By comprehensively analyzing the effective working voltage range of electric springs (ESs), this paper proposes a new control strategy to improve the absorption capacity of ES-based flexible loads for mains voltage fluctuations; thus, enhancing the stability of the microgrid fed by intermittent renewables. Analogous to a mechanical spring, the effective working voltage range of ESs is also restricted by the electric elasticity limit (EEL). In specific circumstances, the ES-based flexible load is incapable of dealing with excessive fluctuations of mains voltage caused by intermittent renewable energy sources. Accordingly, this paper investigates the impact of key parameters on the EEL of ESs, such as the distribution line, the voltage reference, and the loads. Besides, by adjusting the proportion between the critical and the noncritical loads, this paper proposes and implements an EEL controller to regulate the absorption capacity of ES-based flexible loads for mains voltage fluctuations; thus, effectively ensuring the voltage stability of critical loads. Finally, the simulated and experimental results are both given to verify the theoretical analysis for ES-based flexible loads and the feasibility of the proposed EEL controller. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
595	An LCC-Compensated Multiple-Frequency Wireless Motor System	In this paper, a novel kind of wireless motors, namely, the LCC-compensated wireless switched reluctance motor, is proposed and implemented. The definite advantages are that there is no power converter at the motor side and particularly no switched-capacitor array at the transmitter side to realize the multiple-frequency operation. The key is to develop an LCC compensation involving an inductor and two capacitors (the so-called LCC) for a multiple-frequency wireless power transfer system. As a result, only one transmitter is needed to targetedly feed three receivers, which directly energize the three phase windings of the motor. Particularly, there is no need to control switched capacitors to change the resonant frequency of the transmitter. Meanwhile, the burst firing control method is employed to realize the speed control. Both calculation and experimental results are presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed system. In the system prototype, the transmission distance can reach up to 150 mm and the transmission efficiency can be achieved up to 80%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
596	Single Grating Reflective Digital Holography with Double Field of View	Since 1960s, digital holography (DH) has been developed significantly as an exquisite optical sensing technique with its computational interpretation. Recent advances in the image sensor and the coherent light source have suggested the possibility of using DH in portable form that can be utilized in industrial fields. Field of view (FOV) should be sufficiently wide and the system be simple for successful landing of DH on the industrial market. To embody the possibility, in this paper, we present a method for implementing off-axis reflective DH using a single diffraction grating. Beam splitter and mirror in the conventional off-axis DH are replaced with a single diffraction grating. This replacement enables the implementation of simple interferometer while maintaining the performance of the holography. In addition, we apply the multiplexed illumination method to enhance space-bandwidth product of off-axis hologram. Using the wavelength dependence of the diffraction grating, the FOV can be doubled without additional optical element. We demonstrate the proposed method by three holographic imaging experiments with two laser diodes. The prototype provides lateral resolution of 19.69 μm with the FOV of 6.85 mm × 8.72 mm. The FOV is 1.9 times wider than the image sensor area of 6.85 mm × 4.59 mm. Overall size of the prototype is 12 cm × 17 cm × 5 cm, showing the suitability of implementation to the various industrial fields. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
597	A Dynamic Analysis of Energy Storage with Renewable and Diesel Generation Using Volterra Equations	Energy storage systems will play a key role in the power system of the 21st century considering the large penetrations of variable renewable energy, growth in transport electrification, and decentralization of heating loads. Therefore, reliable real-time methods to optimize energy storage, demand response, and generation are vital for power system operations. This article presents a concise review of battery energy storage and an example of battery modeling for renewable energy applications and details an adaptive approach to solve this load leveling problem with storage. A dynamic evolutionary model based on the first-kind Volterra integral equation is used in both cases. A direct regularized numerical method is employed to find the least-cost dispatch of the battery in terms of the integral equation solution. Validation on real data shows that the proposed evolutionary Volterra model effectively generalizes a conventional discrete integral model taking into account both the state of health and the availability of generation/storage. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53
598	Decentralizing IoT management systems using blockchain for censorship resistance	Blockchain technology has been increasingly used for decentralizing cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) architectures to address limitations faced by centralized systems. While many existing efforts are successful in decentralization with multiple servers (i.e., full nodes) to handle faulty nodes, an important issue has arisen that external clients have to rely on a relay node to communicate with the full nodes in the blockchain. Compromization of such relay nodes may result in a security breach and even a blockage of IoT sensors from the network. In this article, we propose blockchain-based decentralized IoT management systems for censorship resistance, which include a 'diffusion' function to deliver all messages from sensors to all full nodes and an augmented consensus protocol to check data losses, replicate processing outcome, and facilitate opportunistic outcome delivery. We also leverage public key aggregation to reduce communication complexity and signature verification. The experimental results from proof-of-concept implementation and deployment in a real distributed environment show the feasibility and effectiveness in achieving censorship resistance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15
599	A Personalized Privacy Protection Framework for Mobile Crowdsensing in IIoT	With the rapid digitalization of various industries, mobile crowdsensing (MCS), an intelligent data collection and processing paradigm of the industrial Internet of Things, has provided a promising opportunity to construct powerful industrial systems and provide industrial services. The existing unified privacy strategy for all sensing data results in excessive or insufficient protection and low quality of crowdsensing services (QoCS) in MCS. To tackle this issue, in this article we propose a personalized privacy protection (PERIO) framework based on game theory and data encryption. Initially, we design a personalized privacy measurement algorithm to calculate users' privacy level, which is then combined with game theory to construct a rational uploading strategy. Furthermore, we propose a privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and real-timeness. Theoretical analysis and ample simulations with real trajectory dataset indicate that the PERIO scheme is effective and makes a reasonable balance between retaining high QoCS and privacy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	109
600	Achieving Personalized k-Anonymity-Based Content Privacy for Autonomous Vehicles in CPS	Enabled by the industrial Internet, intelligent transportation has made remarkable achievements such as autonomous vehicles by carnegie mellon university (CMU) Navlab, Google Cars, Tesla, etc. Autonomous vehicles benefit, in various aspects, from the cooperation of the industrial Internet and cyber-physical systems. In this process, users in autonomous vehicles submit query contents, such as service interests or user locations, to service providers. However, privacy concerns arise since the query contents are exposed when the users are enjoying the services queried. Existing works on privacy preservation of query contents rely on location perturbation or k-anonymity, and they suffer from insufficient protection of privacy or low query utility incurred by processing multiple queries for a single query content. To achieve sufficient privacy preservation and satisfactory query utility for autonomous vehicles querying services in cyber-physical systems, this article proposes a novel privacy notion of client-based personalized k-anonymity (CPkA). To measure the performance of CPkA, we present a privacy metric and a utility metric, based on which, we formulate two problems to achieve the optimal CPkA in term of privacy and utility. An approach, including two modules, to establish mechanisms which achieve the optimal CPkA is presented. The first module is to build in-group mechanisms for achieving the optimal privacy within each content group. The second module includes linear programming-based methods to compute the optimal grouping strategies. The in-group mechanisms and the grouping strategies are combined to establish optimal CPkA mechanisms, which achieve the optimal privacy or the optimal utility. We employ real-life datasets and synthetic prior distributions to evaluate the CPkA mechanisms established by our approach. The evaluation results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the established mechanisms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	63
601	ConnSpoiler: Disrupting C&C Communication of IoT-Based Botnet through Fast Detection of Anomalous Domain Queries	The development of Internet of Things (IoT) dramatically facilitates the integration of computing systems with the physical world. However, as IoT devices are more easy to compromise than desktop computers, cybercriminals have founded IoT-based botnets to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks with unprecedented traffic volume. To mitigate the damages associated with these attacks, the detection of IoT-based botnet has to preempt the command and control (C&C) communication to prevent the delivery of the attack codes. Motivated by the extensively implementation of domain generation algorithm in botnets, in this article, we propose ConnSpoiler, a lightweight system that detects IoT-based botnets by identifying the stream of algorithmically generated domains (AGDs) in a fast way. ConnSpoiler only needs negligible system resources to take effect and thus can execute well on the resource-restraint IoT devices. By outfitting a powerful statistical algorithm, i.e., threshold random walk, ConnSpoiler has a high probability (about 94%) of detecting infection before the compromised devices connect C&C servers, which can help to prevent the succeeding attacks. Moreover, ConnSpoiler only requires the benign domains to take effect and therefore does not need extra effort to label malicious samples for training phase. We evaluate ConnSpoiler based on real-world DNS traffics collected from two different large ISP networks and show that it accurately identifies devices that are compromised by unknown botnets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	38

603	Cross-validated locally polynomial modeling for 2-D/3-D gaze tracking with head-worn devices	In the context of wearable gaze tracking techniques, the problems of two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) gaze estimation can be viewed as inferring 2-D epipolar lines and 3-D visual axes from eye monitoring cameras. To this end, in this article, a simple local polynomial model is proposed to back-project a pupil center onto its corresponding visual axis. Based on this approximation, a homographylike relation is derived in a local manner, and via the Leave-One-Out cross-validation criterion, training gaze samples at one certain depth is leveraged to partition entire input space into multiple overlapping subregions. Then, the gaze data at another depth are utilized to recover the epipolar point, i.e., the image eyeball center. Thus, given a pupil image, the corresponding epipolar line can be determined by the resolved homographylike mapping and the epipolar point. By using the same partition structure, 3-D gaze prediction model can be inferred by solving a nonlinear optimization problem, which aims to minimize the angular disparities between training visual directions and prediction ones. Meanwhile, it is necessary to form a good starting point and suitable constraints for the optimization problem. Otherwise, it may end up with trivial solutions, i.e., faraway eye positions. To facilitate the practical implementation of our proposed method, we also analyze how the spatial distribution of calibration points impacts the model learning accuracy. The experiment results justify the effectiveness of our proposed gaze estimation method for both the normal vision and eyewear users. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
604	Cross-level parallel network for crowd counting	Automated people counting in crowd scenes is challenging due to large variations in scale, density, and background clutter. To tackle them, we propose a novel cross-level parallel network (CLPNet) by extracting multiple low-level features from VGG16 and fusing them with specific scale aggregation modules in the high-level stage. To deal with scale variation, we design five different aggregation modules for multiscale fusion. Furthermore, the ground truth is processed skillfully to eliminate the mismatches caused by the scale variation between heads and density maps. To cope with background clutter, cross-level feature fusion is implemented. Higher-level semantic information could effectively separate head from background and regain the lost low-level detailed information. To address the variation of density, we design a parallel network, in which two separate channels focus on different density-level estimation, and attain more accurate counting results. Finally, we evaluate the proposed CLPNet on four representative crowd counting datasets, i.e., ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, WorldExpo'10, and UCF_QNRF. The experimental results demonstrate that with the cross-level and multiscale structure CLPNet achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art crowd counting methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
605	An SDN-Enabled pseudo-honeypot strategy for distributed denial of service attacks in industrial internet of things	Leveraging high-performance software-defined networks (SDNs) to manage industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices has become a promising trend; the SDN is expected to be the next generation as a unified and virtualized network platform that provides unprecedented automation, flexibility, and efficiency. As the core of business applications and sensitive data storage, the SDN is vulnerable to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in IIoT environment that numerous requests are sent to the SDN to interrupt its services. In the traditional defense systems, honeypots have shown great promises in resisting DDoS attacks. In this paper, we reveal a new attack that can identify honeypots to invalidate their protection. In addition, we analyze the optimal strategies of attackers, so that they can find the best time to carry on attacks. To protect SDN from such a kind of anti-honeypot attacks, we propose a pseudo-honeypot game (PHG) strategy with theoretical performance guarantee. We prove several groups of Bayesian-Nash Equilibrium in the PHG strategy. Moreover, we show that these strategies can achieve the optimal equilibrium between legitimate users and attackers. The proposed honeypot strategies can provide dynamic protection for SDN. Hence, malicious attacks under our strategies can be effectively controlled. Finally, we evaluate our proposals on a testbed, and experimental results show that our proposals can effectively resist DDoS attacks with lower energy consumption compared with the existing methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42
606	Visual attention assessment for expert-in-the-loop training in a maritime operation simulator	Improving the training programs for maritime operations is beneficial to enhance the maritime safety in practice. In this article, we propose a novel approach to the assessment of visual attention in a maritime operation so as to support an expert-in-the-loop training program. Experts' knowledge of maritime operation and experiences in the simulator are incorporated into the training program in three ways. First, through a questionnaire, information about task division, identification of critical operation, and definitions of areas of interest (AOIs) are incorporated as prior knowledge for modeling visual attention. Second, a weight scale factor that emphasizes the high importance of visual focus in critical operations is utilized to generate an operations-dependent attention map. Third, based on an expert's attention map and visual switch between AOIs, a similarity metric is designed as a comprehensive evaluation between saliency and visual transition. A case study of heavy lifting operation is performed by two groups of trainees who have received different briefings about 'critical operation.' The assessment result shows that the group with more detailed briefing obtains a 6% similarity score higher than the other group, which is consistent with the debriefing result of a superior performance of that group. The proposed approach is thus verified effective in assessing visual attention for the expert-in-the-loop training program. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9

608	A privacy-preserving outsourcing scheme for image local binary pattern in secure industrial internet of things	In the era of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), huge amounts of data are generated, and companies are highly motivated to store the data on cloud servers for cost saving and efficient application. However, the IIoT data are always of great value. The direct outsourcing of such data can leak the important information of the companies and cause great business losses. A straightforward solution is to encrypt the data by using standard encryption methods before outsourcing. Nevertheless, this will make data utilization quite inconvenient. This paper focuses on the secure process of image data on cloud servers. Images are stored on cloud servers in encrypted form, and the local binary pattern feature can be directly extracted from the encrypted images for applications.

609	An adaptive encryption-as-a-service architecture based on fog computing for real-time substation communications	The recent outbreak of industrial cyberattacks indicates that the current industrial network security architecture is under serious challenges. As one of the critical industrial networks, the heterogeneous and real-time substation network lacks compatibility with the conventional cryptography architecture represented by secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) and public key infrastructure (PKI). To enhance the security of smart substations under the premise of low latency, in this article, we present a novel encryption-as-a-service architecture based on fog computing in this article. The architecture offloads encryption to dedicated devices and makes certificate and key management available through unified web services on the fog and cloud layers. Based on this architecture, we propose MX-SORTS, maximizing security on real-time communication of different services, an algorithm for adaptive configuration of encrypting and signing substation network traffic. By the contrast experiments with the conventional cryptography architecture, we prove that the encryption-as-a-service architecture can significantly improve the real-time and security performance of substation networks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
610	Self-taught semisupervised dictionary learning with nonnegative constraint	This paper investigates classification by dictionary learning. A novel unified framework termed self-taught semisupervised dictionary learning with nonnegative constraint is proposed for simultaneously optimizing the components of a dictionary and a graph Laplacian. Specifically, an atom graph Laplacian regularization is built by using sparse coefficients to effectively capture the underlying manifold structure. It is more robust to noisy samples and outliers because atoms are more concise and representative than training samples. A nonnegative constraint imposed on the sparse coefficients guarantees that each sample is in the middle of its related atoms. In this way, the dependency between samples and atoms is made explicit. Furthermore, a self-taught mechanism is introduced to effectively feed back the manifold structure induced by atom graph Laplacian regularization and the supervised information hidden in unlabeled samples in order to learn a better dictionary. An efficient algorithm, combining a block coordinate descent method with the alternating direction method of multipliers, is derived to optimize the unified framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	17
611	A temporally irreversible visual attention model inspired by motion sensitive neurons	When a human perceives videos composed of the same images in various orders, such as normal order, reverse order, and random order, the human visual attention system perceives them as different visual inputs. This means that the temporal change in the image sequence exerts a considerable influence on the human visual system. However, most state-of-the-art computational visual attention models have not considered the temporal cues adequately. Motivated by this deficiency, we propose a novel temporally irreversible visual attention model considering the following three aspects. First, the central bias of human dynamic vision is incorporated into the model to manifest this tendency. Second, the depth and directional motion-sensitive neurons are fused to discern different motion patterns. Third, the rarity factor is integrated into the model to mimic the attention shift when human observer perceives new emerging motion cues. The proposed model demonstrates its competitiveness to select attentive events in our experiments, in both laboratory setting and real driving video clips. When compared with recent visual attention models, the proposed model achieves the highest score in similarity with human dynamic vision. The proposed model could be one of the fundamental building blocks for any visual attention systems coping with dynamic scenes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
612	Spatiotemporal saliency detection based on maximum consistency superpixels merging for video analysis	Motion objects detection becomes more and more important in the applications of video surveillance, e.g., intrusion detection. The spatiotemporal saliency is an effective feature to describe object motion. However, there is a lot of redundancy in the spatial information preventing to obtain accurate saliency in an effective way. At the same time, temporal information cannot be accurately described because it is affected by uneven brightness, complex background, and fast-moving objects, especially at the edge of moving objects. In this article, we develop a novel method to tackle these problems and obtain more accurate spatiotemporal saliency. The key idea is the superpixel merging based on our maximum consistency model in feature space, through which the redundant spatial information is decreased and inhibit some temporal information errors. Experimental evaluations on the NNT dataset and surveillance videos show that the proposed method achieves better performance by comparing with some state-of-the-art methods, and can effectively detect intrusion entities. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
613	A session hijacking attack against a device-assisted physical-layer key agreement	Physical-layer key agreement is used to generate a shared key between devices on demand. Such schemes utilize the characteristics of the wireless channel to generate the shared key from the device-to-device channel. As all characteristics are time-dependent and location-dependent, it is hard for eavesdroppers to get the key. However, most research works in this area use passive attack models whereas active attacks that aim at manipulating the channel and key are also possible. Physical-layer key agreement with User Introduced Randomness (PHY-UIR) is a solution similar to the Diffie-Hellman protocol against such a kind of active attack. The users (devices) introduce their own randomness to help to prevent active attacks. In this paper, we analyze the possibility of launching a session hijacking attack on PHY-UIR to allow an attacker to control the shared key established. The session hijacking attack manipulates the key agreement through a man-in-the-middle interaction and forces legitimate devices to run the PHY-UIR protocol with the attacker. Our simulation and experiment results validate our attack and show the high performance of our attack on manipulating the generated key. We also propose PHY-UIR+ where devices simultaneously exchange information about the established shared keys, which allows them to detect whether they have agreed to different keys with a third party. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
614	A hybrid key generation and a verification scheme	By introducing high randomness with reduced computational cost, physical layer (PHY) key generation is one of the candidate tools that can be used for the security of the Internet of Things applications. Nonidentical secret keys are one of the main problems of the physical layer (PHY) key generation schemes. In order to address this problem, key verification schemes, which are based on information reconciliation, are used in this article. In the current key verification techniques, the legitimate nodes reveal some information related to their secret keys to eliminate nonidentical bits. In this article, by jointly using PHY key generation with an embedded key, we propose a hybrid key generation and key verification scheme, where the revealed information during the key verification process is negligible, and the verified keys are identical. Numerical results and software-defined radio-based tests show that the proposed verification scheme achieves the requirements of the Industrial Internet of Things systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
615	Improving night-time pedestrian retrieval with distribution alignment and contextual distance	Night-time pedestrian retrieval is a cross-modality retrieval task of retrieving person images between day-time visible images and night-time thermal images. It is a very challenging problem due to modality difference, camera variations, and person variations, but it plays an important role in night-time video surveillance. The existing cross-modality retrieval usually focuses on learning modality sharable feature representations to bridge the modality gap. In this article, we propose to utilize auxiliary information to improve the retrieval performance, which consistently improves the performance with different baseline loss functions. Our auxiliary information contains two major parts: cross-modality feature distribution and contextual information. The former aligns the cross-modality feature distributions between two modalities to improve the performance, and the latter optimizes the cross-modality distance measurement with the contextual information. We also demonstrate that abundant annotated visible pedestrian images, which are easily accessible, help to improve the cross-modality pedestrian retrieval as well. The proposed method is featured in two aspects: the auxiliary information does not need additional human intervention or annotation; it learns discriminative feature representations in an end-to-end deep learning manner. Extensive experiments on two cross-modality pedestrian retrieval datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, achieving much better performance than the state-of-the-arts. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
616	Navigation and visual feedback control for magnetically driven helical miniature swimmers	In this paper, controlling miniature swimmers via electromagnetic actuation has received considerable attention due to their minor invasive trait in various biomedical applications and ease of passing through the complex environments. Studying the navigation and control system is an essential step towards such applications. Currently, navigation and control for magnetically driven miniature swimmers are still challenging research issues. This paper aims to formulate a navigation and control system of magnetically driven helical miniature swimmers. First, a global planning algorithm named informed optimal random exploring tree (Informed RRT∗) is applied to compute the feasible path in cluttered environments. Second, a closed-loop control algorithm is presented to follow various of reference paths using visual feedback on a planar substrate. In particular, a single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks is employed to approximate the mapping relationship between the magnetic self-rotation direction and the actual moving direction of helical miniature swimmers. The neural network is first implemented to control the magnetically driven miniature swimmers in this paper. Experiments are conducted to verify the ability of navigation and visual feedback control tasks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
617	Pipeline magnetic flux leakage image detection algorithm based on multiscale SSD network	In order to solve the problem of low detection accuracy of small targets in the SSD detection algorithm, a pipeline magnetic flux leakage image detection algorithm based on multiscale SSD network is proposed in this paper. The dilated convolution and attention residual module are introduced into the SSD algorithm to fuse the low-resolution high-semantic information feature map with the high-resolution low-semantic information feature map so as to improve the resolution of the low-resolution feature map and provide detailed features for small targets. Finally, the target location and category are obtained by regression algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can automatically identify the location of circumferential weld, spiral weld, and defect of magnetic flux leakage data. Compared with the original SSD algorithm framework, the improved algorithm has higher detection accuracy, 97.62%, 18.01% lower false detection rate, 18.36% lower false detection rate, better robustness, and obvious effect on small target detection. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	32
618	Efficient implementation of truncated reweighting low-rank matrix approximation	The weighted nuclear norm minimization and truncated nuclear norm minimization are two well-known low-rank constraint for visual applications. In this paper, by integrating their advantages into a unified formulation, we find a better weighting strategy, namely truncated reweighting norm minimization (TRNM), which provides better approximation to the target rank for some specific task. Albeit nonconvex and truncated, we prove that TRNM is equivalent to certain weighted quadratic programming problems, whose global optimum can be accessed by the newly presented reweighting singular value thresholding operator. More importantly, we design a computationally efficient optimization algorithm, namely momentum update and rank propagation (MURP), for the general TRNM regularized problems. The individual advantages of MURP include, first, reducing iterations through nonmonotonic search, and second, mitigating computational cost by reducing the size of target matrix. Furthermore, the descent property and convergence of MURP are proven. Finally, two practical models, i.e., Matrix Completion Problem via TRNM (MCTRNM) and Space Clustering Model via TRNM (SCTRNM), are presented for visual applications. Extensive experimental results show that our methods achieve better performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
619	Enhanced resilient state estimation using data-driven auxiliary models	This paper considers the problem of resiliency in the state estimation of a cyber-physical system when a portion of its sensor measurements contains malicious data added by an adversarial attacker. When the attack consists of arbitrary random uncorrelated data injection, compressive-sensing-based regression algorithms that can recover the true states have been studied extensively in the literature. However, it has been shown that it is possible to create a targeted correlated false data injection attack (FDIA), which will fool any regression-based algorithm. Consequently, there have been a plethora of data-driven approaches investigated to detect the occurrence of such an FDIA. This paper combines a data-driven model with the traditional compressive sensing regression problem. It is shown that the solution of the resulting constrained optimization problem recovers the true states of the system. The developed algorithm is evaluated through a numerical simulation example of the IEEE 14-bus system mapped to the New York Independent System Operator grid data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	27
620	A recursive constrained framework for unsupervised video action clustering	Video action understanding is an active field of intelligent video analytics, and contextual information in the videos has gained lots of attention for better action understanding. However, most existing works focus on using contextual information for supervised or semi-supervised analysis, and how to effectively use contextual information to boost the unsupervised action clustering performance is still a challenging problem. In this article, we propose a recursive constrained framework for unsupervised video action clustering by utilizing the contextual information of the action and scene. Considering the unique contextual characteristics of video action, action context clustering solution and scene context clustering solution are obtained simultaneously. Based on these two solutions, a recursive priori propagation is proposed to exploit information gain of the priori clustering solutions, and then the information gain is fed back into the procedures of both subspace representation and spectral clustering. Specifically, to explore the unknown relationships in the priori clustering solutions, the constraint-guided subspace representation is introduced by fusing the recursive priori constraint into the self-representation model. Taking priori information and multiview features into consideration, the priori-inherited multiview spectral clustering is proposed to obtain more discriminative spectral embeddings for action clustering. Experiments on three video benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11

Securing these devices against all potential threats is a huge challenge. The 5G specification goals require rigid and robust security protocol against such threats. Quantum cryptography is a recently emerged term in which we test the robustness of security protocols against quantum computers. Therefore, in this article, we propose a security protocol called quantum key GRID for authentication and key agreement (QKG-AKA) scheme for the dynamic security association. This scheme is efficiently deployed in long term evolution architecture without any significant modifications in the underlying base system. The proposed QKG-AKA mechanism is analyzed for robustness and proven safe against quantum computers.

622	Point2Volume: A vision-based dietary assessment approach using view synthesis	Dietary assessment is an important tool for nutritional epidemiology studies. To assess the dietary intake, the common approach is to carry out 24-h dietary recall (24HR), a structured interview conducted by experienced dietitians. Due to the unconscious biases in such self-reporting methods, many research works have proposed the use of vision-based approaches to provide accurate and objective assessments. In this article, a novel vision-based method based on real-time three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction and deep learning view synthesis is proposed to enable accurate portion size estimation of food items consumed. A point completion neural network is developed to complete partial point cloud of food items based on a single depth image or video captured from any convenient viewing position. Once 3-D models of food items are reconstructed, the food volume can be estimated through meshing. Compared to previous methods, our method has addressed several major challenges in vision-based dietary assessment, such as view occlusion and scale ambiguity, and it outperforms previous approaches in accurate portion size estimation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24
623	Two-Stage Distributionally Robust Optimization for Energy Hub Systems	Energy hub system (EHS) incorporating multiple energy carriers, storage, and renewables can efficiently coordinate various energy resources to optimally satisfy energy demand. However, the intermittency of renewable generation poses great challenges on optimal EHS operation. This article proposes an innovative distributionally robust optimization model to operate EHS with an energy storage system (ESS), considering the multimodal forecast errors of photovoltaic (PV) power. Both battery and heat storage are utilized to smooth PV output fluctuation and improve the energy efficiency of EHS. This article proposes a novel multimodal ambiguity set to capture the stochastic characteristics of PV multimodality. A two-stage scheme is adopted, where 1) the first stage optimizes EHS operation cost, and 2) the second stage implements real-time dispatch after the realization of PV output uncertainty. The aim is to overcome the conservatism of multimodal distribution uncertainties modeled by typical ambiguity sets and reduce the operation cost of EHS. The presented model is reformulated as a tractable semidefinite programming problem and solved by a constraint generation algorithm. Its performance is extensively compared with widely used normal and unimodal ambiguity sets. The results from this article justify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method compared to conventional models, which can help EHS operators to economically consume energy and use ESS wisely through the optimal coordination of multienergy carriers. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	54

The fifth generation cellular network is expected to be a unifying network that may connect billions of IIoT devices for the sake of supporting advanced IIoT business. In order to realize wide and seamless information coverage, heterogeneous network architecture becomes a beneficial method, which can also improve the near-ceiling network capacity. In order to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) as well as the fairness of different IIoT devices with limited network resources, the network association in IIoT should be performed in a more intelligent manner. In this article, we propose a distributed Q-learning aided power allocation algorithm for two-layer heterogeneous IIoT networks. Moreover, we discuss the spirit of designing reward functions, followed by four delicately defined reward functions considering both the QoS of femtocell IoT user equipments and macrocell IoT user equipments and their fairness.

625	Cyber Vulnerability Intelligence for Internet of Things Binary	Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a variety of software (e.g., autonomous vehicles and military systems) in order to enable the advanced and intelligent services. These software increase the potential of cyber-attacks because an adversary can launch an attack using system vulnerabilities. Existing software vulnerability analysis methods used to be relying on human experts crafted features, which usually miss many vulnerabilities. It is important to develop an automatic vulnerability analysis system to improve the countermeasures. However, source code is not always available (e.g., most IoT related industry software are closed source). Therefore, vulnerability detection on binary code is a demanding task. This article addresses the automatic binary-level software vulnerability detection problem by proposing a deep learning-based approach. The proposed approach consists of two phases: binary function extraction, and model building. First, we extract binary functions from the cleaned binary instructions obtained by using IDA Pro. Then, we employ the attention mechanism on top of a bidirectional long short-term memory for building the predictive model. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have collected datasets from several different sources. We have compared our proposed approach with a series of baselines including source code-based techniques and binary code-based techniques. We have also applied the proposed approach to real-world IoT related software such as VLC media player and LibTIFF project that used on Autonomous Vehicles. Experimental results show that our proposed approach betters the baselines and is able to detect more vulnerabilities. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
626	MTES: An Intelligent Trust Evaluation Scheme in Sensor-Cloud-Enabled Industrial Internet of Things	As an enabler for smart industrial Internet of Things (IoT), sensor cloud facilitates data collection, processing, analysis, storage, and sharing on demand. However, compromised or malicious sensor nodes may cause the collected data to be invalid or even endanger the normal operation of an entire IoT system. Therefore, designing an effective mechanism to ensure the trustworthiness of sensor nodes is a critical issue. However, existing cloud computing models cannot provide direct and effective management for the sensor nodes. Meanwhile, the insufficient computation and storage ability of sensor nodes makes them incapable of performing complex intelligent algorithms. To this end, mobile edge nodes with relatively strong computation and storage ability are exploited to provide intelligent trust evaluation and management for sensor nodes. In this article, a mobile edge computing-based intelligent trust evaluation scheme is proposed to comprehensively evaluate the trustworthiness of sensor nodes using probabilistic graphical model. The proposed mechanism evaluates the trustworthiness of sensor nodes from data collection and communication behavior. Moreover, the moving path for the edge nodes is scheduled to improve the probability of direct trust evaluation and decrease the moving distance. An approximation algorithm with provable performance is designed. Extensive experiments validate that our method can effectively ensure the trustworthiness of sensor nodes and decrease the energy consumption. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	118

In such a scenario, the attacker introduces many attacks to the edge before forwarding them to distributed servers. This necessitates intrusion detection systems for such environments to mitigate security attacks. This paper has projected a basis for characterization of intrusive behaviors in a distributed system based on the functional link neural nets response weighted-average and teaching-learning metaheuristic with elitism on weight-space. The proposed technique makes use of teaching-learning metaheuristic optimization to obtain suitable parameters for the functional link neural net. Furthermore, the processing of duplicate parameters is successfully avoided by using mutation operation. In addition to this, in this paper the proposed method is found to be more efficient in terms of computational burden. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21

In Industry 4.0, efficient content delivery is one of the fundamental challenges to be addressed. Nowadays, the promising solution for content delivery in smart industrial applications is the use of hierarchical caching systems at the network edge (5G small cells). This approach reduces the delay for content delivery and helps improve the performance of smart industrial applications. However, the caching management is a challenging and complex task, especially in those scenarios of shared storage resources on edge devices to support multiple concurrent applications (e.g., industrial, mobile users, and connected cars applications). In this article, we study the performance of a shared edge caching system for content delivery in smart industry and connected cars applications. To do so, we propose a mathematical framework to model the performance of a hierarchical shared edge caching system. The proposed mathematical framework considers the distinct content catalogs of the different applications (e.g., industrial and connected cars applications) and content request characteristics from industrial IoT devices and vehicles. Numerical results show that the performance of the shared edge caching system is sensitive to vehicular mobility (i.e., vehicular speed). © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	27

It is necessary to establish a trusted access system to achieve secure authentication and collaborative sharing. Therefore, this article proposes a distributed and trusted authentication system based on blockchain and edge computing, aiming to improve authentication efficiency. This system consists of physical network layer, blockchain edge layer and blockchain network layer. Through the blockchain network, an optimized practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm is designed to construct a consortium blockchain for storing authentication data and logs. It guarantees trusted authentication and achieves activity traceability of terminals. Furthermore, edge computing is applied in blockchain edge nodes, to provide name resolution and edge authentication service based on smart contracts. Meanwhile, an asymmetric cryptography is designed, to prevent connection between nodes and terminals from being attacked. And a caching strategy based on edge computing is proposed to improve hit ratio. Our proposed authentication mechanism is evaluated with respect to communication and computation costs.

To solve this problem, we propose a secure random key distribution (SRKD) scheme, which provides a new method for the defense against the attack. Specifically, we combine a localized algorithm with a voting mechanism to support the detection and revocation of malicious nodes. We further change the meaning of the parameter s} to help prevent the replication attack. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the detection ratio of replicate nodes exceeds 90% when the number of network nodes reaches 200, which demonstrates the security and effectiveness of our scheme.

In this paper, a novel radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) based adaptive sliding mode control design is proposed for nonlinear multilateral telerobotic system with n-master-n-slave manipulators. The environment force is modeled with a general form via the RBFNN-based environment parameters estimation in the slave side. The estimated environment parameters (nonpower signals) are transmitted to rebuild the environment dynamics in the master side and provide the good force feedback for the human operators. The RBFNN-based adaptive sliding mode controllers are designed separately for master and slave manipulators to achieve good position tracking under parameter variations and external disturbance. The coordinated force distribution algorithm is designed to achieve cooperative manipulation with the balance of force acting on the target object. The theoretical analysis is given and the comparative experiment for a nonlinear multilateral telerobotic system with 2-master-2-slave manipulators is implemented.

Therefore, the edge devices, especially smart industrial edge devices, require higher storage systems. NAND flash memory has the advantages of small size, high speed, and strong shock resistance, which is widely used in various storage systems, providing a good choice for edge devices. NAND flash has unique physical characteristics, such as 'out-of-place updates' and 'prewrite erasure,' therefore, the traditional address mapping methods require improvement. This article presents a novel demand-based page-level address mapping algorithm called DPAM. The goal of DPAM is to provide efficient address translation by using a smaller address mapping table. Due to the high service cost of block-level address mapping and hybrid address mapping, a page-level address mapping scheme is proposed. The algorithm is implemented and tested on the flash simulation platform FlashSim.

636	Autonomous power management with double-q reinforcement learning method	Energy efficiency and autonomous power management are extremely important for mobile-edge computing. Reducing energy consumption of a number of applications running concurrently in mobile devices while maintaining performance poses a challenge to energy optimization due to the limited capacity of the embedded battery. To extend battery life and offer a long-lasting working energy, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been widely used in mobile devices for energy consumption minimization. However, most conventional DVFS techniques scale operating frequency based on static policies, and thus, they are difficult to be adapted to systems of varied conditions. In order to improve adaptivity, in this article, we proposed a Double-Q power management approach to scale operating frequency based on learning. The Double-Q method stores two Q tables and two corresponding update functions. In each decision point, either of Q tables is randomly chosen and updated, while the other is used for the measurement. This mechanism reduces the overestimation in Q values, consequently enhancing the accurateness of frequency predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, a Double-Q governor is implemented in the Linux kernel. Our approach is computationally light, and experimental results indicate that it achieves at least 5-18\% total energy saving compared to ondemand and conservative governors, as well as Q learning-based method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
637	Federated Tensor Mining for Secure Industrial Internet of Things	In a vertical industry alliance, Internet of Things (IoT) deployed in different smart factories are similar. For example, most automobile manufacturers have the similar assembly lines and IoT surveillance systems. It is common to observe the industrial knowledge using deep learning and data mining methods based on the IoT data. However, some knowledge is not easy to be mined from only one factory's data because the samples are still few. If multiple factories within an alliance can gather their data together, more knowledge could be mined. However, the key concern of these factories is the data security. Existing matrix-based methods can guarantee the data security inside a factory but do not allow the data sharing among factories, and thus their mining performance is poor due to lack of correlation. To address this concern, in this article we propose the novel federated tensor mining (FTM) framework to federate multisource data together for tensor-based mining while guaranteeing the security. The key contribution of FTM is that every factory only needs to share its ciphertext data for security issue, and these ciphertexts are adequate for tensor-based knowledge mining due to its homomorphic attribution. Real-data-driven simulations demonstrate that FTM not only mines the same knowledge compared with the plaintext mining, but also is enabled to defend the attacks from distributed eavesdroppers and centralized hackers. In our typical experiment, compared with the matrix-based privacy-preserving compressive sensing (PPCS), FTM increases up to 24% on mining accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

Deep learning has provided a promising opportunity to extract useful knowledge by utilizing vast amounts of data in IIoT. However, lacking of massive public datasets will lead to low performance and overfitting of the learned model. Therefore, the federated deep learning over distributed datasets has been proposed. Whereas, it inevitably introduces some new security challenges, i.e., disclosing participant's data privacy. However, existing methods cannot guarantee each participant's data privacy in a learning group. In this article, we propose two privacy-preserving asynchronous deep learning schemes [privacy-preserving and asynchronous deep learning via re-encryption (DeepPAR) and dynamic privacy-preserving and asynchronous deep learning (DeepDPA)]. Compared to the state-of-the-art work, DeepPAR protects each participant's input privacy while preserving dynamic update secrecy inherently. Meanwhile, DeepDPA enables to guarantee backward secrecy of group participants in a lightweight manner.

In this article, a blockchain-based trusted data management scheme (called BlockTDM) in edge computing is proposed to solve the above problems, in which we proposed a flexible and configurable blockchain architecture that includes mutual authentication protocol, flexible consensus, smart contract, block and transaction data management, blockchain nodes management, and deployment. The BlockTDM scheme can support matrix-based multichannel data segment and isolation for sensitive or privacy data protection, and moreover, we have designed user-defined sensitive data encryption before the transaction payload stores in blockchain system, and have implemented conditional access and decryption query of the protected blockchain data and transactions through smart contract. Finally, we have evaluated the proposed BlockTDM scheme security, availability, and efficiency with large amount of experiments. Analysis and evaluations manifest that the proposed BlockTDM scheme provides a general, flexible, and configurable blockchain-based paradigm for trusted data management with tamper-resistance, which is suitable for edge computing with high-level security and creditability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	79

Thus, in this article, we introduce a blockchain-based mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for edge-computing-based smart grid systems. Specifically, leveraging blockchain, the protocol can support efficient conditional anonymity and key management, without the need for other complex cryptographic primitives. The security analysis shows that the protocol achieves reasonable security assurance, and the comparative summary for security and efficiency also suggests the potential of the proposed protocol in a smart grid deployment. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	107

While providing us considerable convenience, cloud-based computing and storage also bring us many security problems, such as the abuse of information collection and concentrated web servers in the cloud. Traditional intrusion detection systems and web application firewalls are becoming incompatible with the new network environment, and related systems with machine learning or deep learning are emerging.

642	Distributed Key Management in Microgrids	Security for smart industrial systems is prominent due to the proliferation of cyber threats threatening national critical infrastructures. Smart grid comes with intelligent applications that can utilize the bidirectional communication network among its entities. Microgrids are small-scale smart grids that enable machine-to-machine (M2M) communications as they can operate with some degree of independence from the main grid. In addition to protecting critical microgrid applications, an underlying key management scheme is needed to enable secure M2M message transmission and authentication. Existing key management schemes are not adequate due to microgrid special features and requirements. In this article, we propose the Micro sElf-orgaNiSed mAnagement (MENSA), which is the first hybrid key management and authentication scheme that combines public key infrastructure and web-of-trust concepts in microgrids. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of MENSA in terms of scalability and swiftness. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
643	UAV-Enhanced Intelligent Offloading for Internet of Things at the Edge	With the explosive growth of diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been brought to settle the conflict between computation-intensive applications and resource-limited IoT mobile devices (IMDs). Note that the assistance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is of great importance in providing reliable connectivity in areas with limited or no available communication infrastructure. To cope with the surging demands for Big Data processing from UAV-aided IoT applications, combining UAV-aided communication and MEC has been envisioned to be a promising paradigm, which gives rise to the so-called UAV-enhanced edge. In consideration of IMDs' limited battery capacity and UAV energy budget, in this article we study the energy reduction problem in UAV-enhanced edge by smartly making offloading decisions, allocating transmitted bits in both uplink and downlink, as well as designing UAV trajectory. This joint optimization problem is formulated as a mix-integer nonconvex optimization problem, and an alternative optimization algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques is proposed as our solution. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the overall energy consumption for accomplishing the tasks can be effectively reduced by adopting our joint optimization scheme, and the necessity of task offloading, UAV trajectory design, and bit allocation during transmission is validated. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	133
644	Efficient and Secure Anonymous Authentication with Location Privacy for IoT-Based WBANs	Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based wireless body area networks (WBANs) play an important role in modern medical systems for patient-health monitoring. WBANs have the capability to collect real-time biological information from the patients' body using intelligent sensors and then send the collected information to the remote doctors or medical experts using the Internet. In recent years, numerous anonymous authentication schemes were proposed to provide security in WBANs. However, many of these schemes are not computationally efficient during anonymous authentication. Moreover, the previous schemes did not provide location privacy for both doctors and patients. In order to overcome these limitations, in this article, we propose an efficient and secure anonymous authentication framework with location privacy preservation for IoT-based WBANs. The comprehensive analysis section shows that the proposed scheme overcomes the security weaknesses in the existing schemes and also provides low computation cost during anonymous authentication. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	66
645	An Industrial Network Intrusion Detection Algorithm Based on Multifeature Data Clustering Optimization Model	Industrial networks are complex and diverse. Among existing intrusion prevention systems available, several of them have problems such as low detection accuracy rate, high false positive (FP) rate, and low real-time performance for impersonation attacks. To address such issues, it is proposed in this article an industrial network intrusion detection algorithm based on multifeature data clustering optimization model, where the weighted distances and security coefficients of data are classified based on the priority threshold of data attribute feature for each node in the network, given that the data modules in the industrial network environment are diverse and easy to diagnose, restore, and rebuild. The proposed algorithm can effectively improve the detection rate and real-time performance of detecting abnormal behavior for the multifeature data in industrial networks. The novel features are twofold, to rapidly select a node with high-security coefficient as the cluster center, and match the multifeature data around the center into a cluster. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good superiority in terms of detection rate and time compared to other algorithms. In the industrial network, the detection accuracy of abnormal data reaches 97.8%, and the FP of detection is decreased by 8.8%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	110

647	Online GMM Clustering and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent Based Optimization for Industrial IoT 4.0	The future fifth-generation (5G) networks are expected to support a huge number of connected devices with various and multitude services having different quality of service (QoS) requirements. Communication in Industry 4.0 is one of the flagships and special applications of the 5G due to the specificity of the industrial environment as well as the variety of its services such as safety communication, robot's communications, and machine monitoring. In this context, we propose a new resource allocation for the future Industry 4.0 based on software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies, machine learning tools and the slicing paradigm where each slice of the network is dedicated to a category of services having similar QoS requirement level. In this article, the proposed solution ensures the allocation of the resources to the slices depending on their requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay, and reliability. Toward this goal, our solution is performed in three main steps: first, Internet of Things (IoT) devices assignment to the slices step based on online Gaussian mixture model clustering algorithm, second, inter-slices resources reservations step based on mini-batch gradient descent, and third, intra-slices resources allocations based on the max-utility algorithm. We have performed extensive simulations in a realistic industrial scenario using NS3 simulator. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed solution in terms of reducing packet error rate, energy consumption, and in terms of increasing the percentage of served devices in delay comparing to the traditional approaches. © 2019 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22

Specifically, the approximated discrete-time model of the converters with multiple disturbances is first obtained and analyzed based on the Euler's discretization method. Then, by adopting the delayed estimation technique, it is easy to obtain the accurate estimations of the lumped disturbances. Integrating disturbance compensations into the modified digital fast terminal sliding mode surface, the proposed controller is finally constructed on the basis of equivalent control method and the performance analysis is presented.

This surface has no singularity and can guarantee the settling time to be independent of initial states. An adaptive fixed-Time attitude control law is then synthesized, which is continuous and chattering free. It is rigorously proved that the states of the spacecraft attitude system can converge into a small neighborhood after fixed time.

651	Fixed-Time Control with Uncertainty and Measurement Noise Suppression for Hypersonic Vehicles via Augmented Sliding Mode Observers	Uncertainty and measurement noise are main obstacles that limit the tracking control performances of flexible air-breathing hypersonic vehicles (FAHVs). In this article, we propose a novel fixed-time convergent nonsmooth backstepping control scheme for FAHV via augmented sliding mode observers (ASMOs) to overcome these obstacles. The ASMOs are first designed for the FAHV dynamics by employing the measured states corrupted by noises as inputs. On one hand, the ASMOs can simultaneously estimate the uncertainties and filter out the measurement noises. On the other hand, the observation error of each ASMO can be convergent within a fixed time independent of its initial observation error. Then, based on the estimation results, the altitude and velocity tracking controllers are developed by using fixed-time nonsmooth backstepping technique. Afterwards, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis is given to illustrate the fixed-time convergence of the closed-loop signals of the FAHV control system. Finally, comparative simulations are conducted to illustrate the superiority of the proposed control scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	37

However, existing obstacles in controlling receive buffer restrict throughput even when higher bandwidth is available. Therefore, in this article, we propose a smart collaborative automation (SCA) scheme to improve resource usage and overcome buffer limitations. First, a mathematical model is established to describe primary system operations with considerations of chunk loss. The inf-supremum methodology and probability theory are adopted to track congestion window variations. Second, differences in disordered chunk expectations are analyzed to locate the critical condition of round numbers. Specific algorithm details are provided via simplifying comparison to achieve comprehensive policy selections. Third, evaluation topologies and environments are created with reasonable parameter settings. Validation results demonstrate that model-driven SCA can reduce unexpected occupations at the receiver-side. Comparing to intuition-driven schemes, overall performances, in terms of the sender's transmission capacity and receiver's buffer utilization, are improved under different experimental configurations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	58
653	BIM Big Data Storage in WebVRGIS	In the context of big data and the Internet of Things, with the advancement of geospatial data acquisition and retrieval, the volume of available geospatial data is increasing every minute. Thus, new data-management architecture is needed. We proposed a building information model (BIM) big data-storage-management solution with hybrid storage architecture based on web virtual reality geographical information system (WebVRGIS). BIM is associated with the integration of spatial and semantic information on the various stages of urban building. In this paper, based on the spatial distribution characteristics of BIM geospatial big data, a data storage and management model is proposed for BIM geospatial big data management. The architecture primarily includes Not only Structured Query Language (NoSQL) database and distributed peer-to-peer storage. The evaluation of the proposed storage method is conducted on the same software platform as our previous research about WebVR. The experimental results show that the hybrid storage architecture proposed in this research has a lower response time compared to the traditional relational database in geospatial big data searches. The integration and fusion of BIM big data in WebVRGIS realizes a revolutionary transformation of city information management during a full lifecycle. The system also has great promise for the storage of other geospatial big data, such as traffic data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	104
654	Dynamic Embedding and Quality of Service-Driven Adjustment for Cloud Networks	Cloud computing built on virtualization technologies can provide Internet service providers (SPs) with elastic virtualized node and link resources. SPs can outsource their virtualized resources as customized virtual networks (VNs) to end users. Hence, how to efficiently embed these VNs is the core issue in virtualization research. This technical issue is virtual network embedding (VNE). Since the issue inception, multiple mapping algorithms have been studied, including the reinforcement learning (RL) approach of machine learning. However, prior mapping algorithms are mostly static. Existing dynamic mapping algorithms just focus on accepting as many VNs as possible. No existing dynamic algorithm considers optimizing the quality of service (QoS) performance of each accepted VN. Optimizing the VN QoS performance is beneficial to guaranteeing service quality in cloud computing environment. On these backgrounds, we jointly investigate the dynamic VN embedding and optimize the QoS performance of each accepted VN. A dynamic heuristic algorithm is proposed in order to be evaluated in continuous time. When one VN service is requested, the VN will be mapped by the dynamic heuristic algorithm. If the QoS demand of the VN is not guaranteed, the reembedding scheme of the heuristic algorithm will be driven. Certain virtual elements of the VN will be adjusted. The dynamic embedding algorithm ensures flexible VN assignment and fulfills customized QoS demands. Finally, simulation results are illustrated in order to validate the strength of our dynamic algorithm. We perform the comparison with multiple existing dynamic algorithms. For instance, VN acceptance ratio of our dynamic heuristic algorithm improves at least 13%. © 2019 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42
655	Robust Excitation Force Estimation and Prediction for Wave Energy Converter M4 Based on Adaptive Sliding-Mode Observer	The wave excitation force estimation and prediction play an important role in improving the performance of causal and noncausal controllers for wave energy converters (WECs). This article proposes a robust adaptive sliding-mode observer (ASMO) to estimate the wave excitation force subject to unknown disturbances and parametric uncertainties for a multimotion multifloat WEC, called M4. Both the convergence time and the estimation error can be explicitly bounded within expected limits by tuning the ASMO parameters, which are essentially beneficial for causal controllers to maintain the control performance. A fixed-time convergent sliding variable is designed to drive the estimation error into a small region within a fixed time. Due to the adaptive law, the overall system is proven to be finite-time stable, which allows explicit formulations of the convergence time and the estimation error. Moreover, based on the wave force estimation by the ASMO, an improved auto-regressive (AR) model whose coefficients are updated by online training is developed to predict the wave excitation force. The prediction errors can also be explicitly estimated to achieve guaranteed control performance for the noncausal controller requiring future excitation force. From the comparison based on a realistic sea wave gathered from Cornwall, U.K., it can be found that compared with the conventional Kalman filter, the ASMO achieves a smaller steady-state estimation error and has satisfactory robustness performance against 30% model mismatch. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
656	Finite-Time Observer-Based Sliding Mode Control for Quantized Semi-Markov Switching Systems with Application	This article investigates the problem of sliding mode control (SMC) for semi-Markov switching systems (S-MSSs) with quantized measurement in finite-time level. The transition between different subsystems obeys a stochastic semi-Markov process related to nonexponential distribution. Additionally, due to the sensor information constraints, the state vectors are not always measurable in practice. Moreover, compared with existing results in literature, the output quantization is first considered for finite-time SMC problem via a logarithmic quantizer. Our attention is to design an appropriate finite-time SMC law to attenuate the influences of parametrical uncertainty and external disturbance onto the overall performance of the system under consideration. First, by the key points of stochastic semi-Markov Lyapunov function and observer design theory, a desired SMC law is constructed to guarantee that the system trajectories can arrive at the specified sliding surface (SSS) within an assigned finite-time level. Then, ST-dependent sufficient conditions are established to ensure the required finite-time boundedness performance including both reaching phase and sliding motion phase. Finally, the applicability of the proposed results is demonstrated by a single-link robot arm model. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	57

Besides, a directed-graph-based observer is designed to estimate the battery current considering the communication between the ESUs, and based on this observer, an estimation algorithm for adaptive coefficients is developed. Then, the multiagent sliding mode control strategy with an antiwindup compensator of input constraint is developed to track the reference current with little chattering in the DESS, and the stability proof is given. Finally, simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the newly designed control strategy for the DESS. © 2019 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
659	Fuzzy Disturbance Observer-Based Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for Reusable Launch Vehicles with Aeroservoelastic Characteristic	This paper investigates the problem of attitude tracking control for reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) with aeroservoelastic characteristic and disturbances in reentry phase. An aeroservoelastic model for reentry RLV is first established, where the synthetic disturbances are considered as well. Then a novel disturbance observer combined with fuzzy logic system is constructed by using both fuzzy approximation error and observation error to provide the disturbance estimation. The fuzzy disturbance observer (FDO) can be employed to the control scheme to counteract the perturbations and guarantee the estimation errors for converging to a small neighborhood around origin. Incorporated with the designed FDOs, the adaptive sliding mode technique is proposed for developing attitude angle and angular rate subsystem controllers, respectively, to ensure the reentry attitude tracking performance. Rigorous proof shows that the uniform stability of the closed-loop system under the proposed control law can be guaranteed by using Lyapunov technique.

660	An Improved Sliding-Mode Current Control of Induction Machine in Presence of Voltage Constraints	This article proposes a novel approach to design sliding-mode control (SMC) for an induction motor (IM) in the presence of operational constraints. Different from the traditional techniques in SMC, the proposed method assumes the existence of a constant input disturbance and incorporates it in the switching current control law. Effectively, this leads to integral action through disturbance estimation together with an antiwindup mechanism naturally occurring when the control signal reaches its operational limits. The finite-time convergence of the SMC law is established through a Lyapunov analysis. Experimental evaluations are performed on an industrial-sized IM, where the current dynamics of the motor are controlled using SMC, and a velocity proportional-integral (PI) controller is used for the outer-loop control system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed sliding-mode current control systems provide much improved closed-loop control performance over the traditional SMC system. Further comparative experimental studies with well-designed PI current controllers provide insight into the characteristics of the proposed current control systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

Community search in SIOT is an important problem beneficial to the resource/service discovery. In this article, we address the problem from the perspective of a dense subgraph query. Specifically, we propose a core-based static dense subgraph query and a graph kernel based dynamic dense subgraph query. The two algorithms consider the large scale and the time-varying nature of the SIoT, respectively. Unlike the existing works, the static method is inspired by the first-connection-last-expansion idea. Top-k neighbors of each query node are first found by a random walk. Then, all the query nodes and their top-k neighbors are connected as the core using Steiner tree expansion. The rank constraint random sampling is utilized to extend the core to a dense subgraph. Further, by leveraging a graph kernel index and identifying the updates that may affect the results, we conduct the dynamic query in an incremental update way instead of executing it from scratch. The experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed algorithms are both effective and efficient. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5

A sequence-to-sequence model in the form of a nonlinear state-observer/encoder and predictor/decoder was proposed. The observer can be trained using a large amount of unlabeled data, but in a supervised manner in which the process dynamics is tracked. The encoder output and manipulated variables are used to train the quality predictor. The model is applied to the product impurity predictions of an industrial column. Results show that good predictions and excellent consistency in the sign of estimated gains can be achieved even with limited amount of data.

User profiling has become an important issue for industries to improve company profit. In the 5G era, smartphone applications have become an indispensable part in our everyday lives. Users determine what apps to install based on their personal needs, interests, and tastes, which is likely shaped by their genders - the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with their sex. It is possible to profile users' gender based simply on a single snapshot of apps installed on their smartphones. With this inference based on easy to access data, we can make smartphone systems more user-friendly, and provide better personalized products and services. In this article, we explore such possibilities through an empirical study on a large-scale dataset of installed app lists from 15 000 Android users. More specifically, we investigate the following research questions: 1) What differences between females and males can be explored from installed app lists? 2) Can user gender be reliably inferred from a snapshot of apps installed? Which snapshot feature(s) are the most predictive? What is the best combination of features for building the gender prediction model? 3) What are the limitations of a gender prediction model based solely on a snapshot of apps installed on a smartphone? We find significant gender differences in app type, function, and icon design. We then extract the corresponding features from a snapshot of apps installed to infer the gender of each user. We assess the gender predictive ability of individual features and combinations of different features. We achieve an accuracy of 76.62% and area under the curve of 84.23% with the best set of features, outperforming the existing work by around 5% and 10%, respectively. Finally, we perform an error analysis on misclassified users and discussed the implications and limitations of this article. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9

In this article, we propose a two-dimensional deep correlated representation learning (2D-DCRL) method to achieve the efficient fault detection and isolation of the nonlinear batch processes. Three-way historical data are first unfolded as two-way time-slice data. Second, a stacked autoencoder based deep neural network is constructed to characterize the correlation among the process variables. Considering that the time and batch directions may be dynamic, for each time-slice measurement, a constructed 2-D measurement containing samples from the previous time instants and batches is then obtained. Subsequently, DCRL is performed between the current running-batch measurements and the constructed 2-D measurements to characterize the 2-D dynamics and nonlinearity. The 2D-DCRL-based monitoring examines the status of a sample by considering the 2-D nonlinear and dynamic information, providing improved monitoring performance. Applications on two typical batch processes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 2D-DCRL monitoring scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	33

It is applied to the deep-learning of the converter mouth flame spectrum information. The dynamic prediction model of carbon content and temperature value in molten steel at the later stage of steelmaking is constructed. The static control system and dynamic prediction model of automatic steelmaking are intelligently fused to realize one-key steelmaking control. The results show that the average hit rate of carbon content, temperature, and carbon temperature at the end of steelmaking is 94.78%, 98.41%, and 93.43%, which makes the end-point control of steelmaking more stable and the blowing rate less than 1%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
672	Artificial Intelligence for Detection, Estimation, and Compensation of Malicious Attacks in Nonlinear Cyber-Physical Systems and Industrial IoT	This article proposes a hybrid intelligent-classic control approach for reconstruction and compensation of cyber attacks launched on inputs of nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPS) and industrial Internet of Things systems, which work through shared communication networks. In this article, a class of n-order nonlinear systems is considered as a model of CPS while it is in presence of cyber attacks only in the forward channel. An intelligent-classic control system is developed to compensate cyber-attacks. Neural network (NN) is designed as an intelligent estimator for attack estimation and a classic nonlinear control system based on the variable structure control method is designed to compensate the effect of attacks and control the system performance in tracking applications. In the proposed strategy, nonlinear control theory is applied to guarantee the stability of the system when attacks happen. In this strategy, a Gaussian radial basis function NN is used for online estimation and reconstruction of cyber-attacks launched on the networked system. An adaptation law of the intelligent estimator is derived from a Lyapunov function. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed strategy in car cruise control application as the testbed. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	128
673	Intelligent Embedded Vision for Summarization of Multiview Videos in IIoT	Nowadays, video sensors are used on a large scale for various applications, including security monitoring and smart transportation. However, the limited communication bandwidth and storage constraints make it challenging to process such heterogeneous nature of Big Data in real time. Multiview video summarization (MVS) enables us to suppress redundant data in distributed video sensors settings. The existing MVS approaches process video data in offline manner by transmitting them to the local or cloud server for analysis, which requires extra streaming to conduct summarization, huge bandwidth, and are not applicable for integration with industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This article presents a light-weight convolutional neural network (CNN) and IIoT-based computationally intelligent (CI) MVS framework. Our method uses an IIoT network containing smart devices, Raspberry Pi (RPi) (clients and master) with embedded cameras to capture multiview video data. Each client RPi detects target in frames via light-weight CNN model, analyzes these targets for traffic and crowd density, and searches for suspicious objects to generate alert in the IIoT network. The frames of each client RPi are encoded and transmitted with approximately 17.02% smaller size of each frame to master RPi for final MVS. Empirical analysis shows that our proposed framework can be used in industrial environments for various applications such as security and smart transportation and can be proved beneficial for saving resources.11[Online].

674	Automobile Driver Fingerprinting: A New Machine Learning Based Authentication Scheme	Advanced technologies are constantly emerging in automobile industry, which not only provides drivers with a comfortable driving experience, but also enhances the safety of passengers. However, there are still some security issues need to be solved in automobiles, such as automobile driver fingerprinting. At present, identification technologies, such as fingerprint recognition and iris recognition, cannot monitor the driver's identity in real-time manner. Therefore, it is of great significance to design a real-time automobile driver fingerprinting scheme to ensure the safety of people's properties and even lives. Different from previous work concerning automobile driver fingerprinting, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive study on behavioral characteristics of drivers in two vehicles, namely Luxgen U5 SUV and Buick Regal. We exploit the actual data of the controller area network to construct a driver identity comparison library by extracting and processing the feature data. Then, we construct a combined model based on convolutional neural network and support vector domain description to achieve efficient automobile driver fingerprinting. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed driver fingerprinting scheme can dynamically match the driver's identity in real time without affecting the normal driving. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	57
675	Supervised Variational Autoencoders for Soft Sensor Modeling with Missing Data	Autoencoder (AE) is a deep neural network that has been widely utilized in process industry owing to its superior abilities of feature extraction and data reconstruction. Recently, assuming the latent variables to be random variables, a probabilistic variant of it called variational autoencoder (VAE) has achieved a major success in different applications. In this article, we develop two novel submodels based on deep VAEs (DVAE), which are further utilized to establish a soft sensor framework. By the use of our first submodel known as supervised DVAE (SDVAE), the distribution information of latent features can be obtained. This is used as a prior of the second submodel known as the modified unsupervised DVAE (MUDVAE). Then, a new soft sensor framework can be constructed by combing the encoder of SDVAE with the decoder of MUDVAE. Since our designed VAE has superior ability in data reconstruction, it also works well under the missing data situation which is common in process industries due to sensor failures. Thus, we extend the proposed soft sensor framework to handle the missing data situation. The effectiveness of our proposed soft sensor frameworks is finally demonstrated via an industrial polymerization dataset. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53
676	A Big Data-Enabled Consolidated Framework for Energy Efficient Software Defined Data Centers in IoT Setups	The rapidly evolving industry standards and transformative advances in the field of Internet of Things are expected to create a tsunami of Big Data shortly. This, in turn, will demand real-time data analysis and processing from cloud computing platforms. A substantial part of the computing infrastructure is supported by large-scale and geographically distributed data centers (DCs). Nevertheless, these DCs impose a substantial cost in terms of rapidly growing energy consumption, which in turn adversely affects the environment. In this context, efficient resource utilization is seen as a potential candidate to enhance energy efficiency and minimize the load on the power sector. Nevertheless, in the majority of the public clouds, the resources are idle most of the time (i.e., under-utilized) as the load of the servers is unpredictable; thereby leading to a lofty increase in the energy utilization index and wastage of resources. Thus, it is highly essential to devise a precise and efficient resource management technique. Therefore, in this article, we leverage the advantages of software defined data centers (SDDCs) to minimize energy utilization levels. Precisely, SDDC refers to the process of programmatically abstracting the logical computing, network, and storage resources; and configuring them in real-time based on workload demands. In detail, we demonstrate the possibility of 1) designing a consolidated SDDC-based model to jointly optimize the process of virtual machine (VM) deployment and network bandwidth allocation for reduced energy consumption and guaranteed quality of service (QoS), particularly for heterogeneous computing infrastructures; 2) formulating a multiobjective optimization problem to deduce the optimal allocation of resources for both critical and noncritical applications; and 3) designing an efficient scheme based on heuristics to provide suboptimal results for the formulated multiobjective optimization problem. The proposed article presents a suboptimal approach based on first fit decreasing algorithm. Further, our empirical evaluations suggest that the proposed framework leads to almost 27.9% savings in terms of energy consumptions against the existing schemes with negligible QoS violations (approximately 0.33). © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53
677	Fuzzy Correlation Measurement Algorithms for Big Data and Application to Exchange Rates and Stock Prices	In the era of Internet of people and things, big data are merging. Conventional computation algorithms including correlation measures become inefficient to deal with big data problems. Motivated by this observation, we present three fuzzy correlation measurement algorithms, that is, the centroid-based measure, the integral-based measure, and the α-cut-based measure using fuzzy techniques. Data of Shanghai stock price index (SSI) and exchange rates of main foreign currencies over China Yuan from 22 January 2013 to 17 May 2018 are used to check the effectiveness of our algorithms, and, more importantly, to observe the causality relationship between SSI and these main exchange rates. We have observed some findings as follows. First, the usage of the highest, lowest, or closing values in daily exchange rates and stock prices has impact on the significant Granger causes of exchange rates over SSI, but does not produce any opposite cause from SSI to exchange rates. Second, no matter which of our fuzzy measurement algorithms is used, Hongkong Dollar over China Yuan and U.S. Dollar over China Yuan are positively related with SSI, and Euro over China Yuan negatively correlated with SSI is always recognized as a Granger cause to SSI with the significance level being 1%. Finally, both the optimism level and the uncertainty level are observed having impact on the correlation coefficients, but the later brings more significant changes to results of the Granger causality tests. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
678	When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets 5G-Enabled Vehicular Networks: A Distributed Offloading Framework for Traffic Big Data	The emerging 5G-enabled vehicular networks can satisfy various requirements of vehicles by traffic offloading. However, limited cellular spectrum and energy supplies restrict the development of 5G-enabled applications in vehicular networks. In this article, we construct an intelligent offloading framework for 5G-enabled vehicular networks, by jointly utilizing licensed cellular spectrum and unlicensed channels. A cost minimization problem is formulated by considering the latency constraint of users and is further decomposed into two subproblems due to its complexity. For the first subproblem, a two-sided matching algorithm is proposed to schedule the unlicensed spectrum. Then, a deep-reinforcement-learning-based method is investigated for the second one, where the system state is simplified to realize distributed traffic offloading. Real-world traces of taxies are leveraged to illustrate the effectiveness of our solution. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	95
679	Deep-Learning-Based Small Surface Defect Detection via an Exaggerated Local Variation-Based Generative Adversarial Network	Surface detection of small defects plays a vital role in manufacturing and has attracted broad interest. It remains challenging primarily due to the small size of the defect relative to the large surface and the rare occurrence of defects. To address this problem, in this article we propose a novel machine vision approach for automatically identifying the tiny flaws that may appear in a single image. First, the presented defect exaggeration approach produces both the flawless image and the corresponding exaggerated version of the defect by taking the variations in the image as regularization terms. Second, a generative adversarial network (GAN) in conjunction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to guarantee the accuracy of tiny surface defect detection by producing exaggerated defect image samples. Furthermore, the limited dataset of the training samples for defect detection is enlarged by exploiting the GAN technique with the variation exaggerated images. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct comparison experiments between the state-of-the-art techniques with and without the proposed algorithm as well as comparison experiments between the state-of-the-art techniques and our method. The experimental results on different types of surface image samples demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art approaches while achieving a defect detection accuracy of 99.2%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	43
680	Independent Component Analysis-Based Baseline Drift Interference Suppression of Portable Spectrometer for Optical Electronic Nose of Internet of Things	The optical electronic nose (e-nose) is drawing more and more attention from the academia and industry in Internet of Things applications. Since the charge-coupled Device (CCD)-based portable spectrometer is commonly used in gas sensing system of e-nose, the baseline drift interference is easy to be introduced, which reduces the accuracy and sensitivity of the system and makes the sensing performance worse. For this issue, first, the baseline drift data are analyzed and the characteristics of the baseline drift interference brought by the portable spectrometer are found in this article. Then, according to the characteristics of the drift, a baseline drift suppression technique for portable spectrometer is proposed. Specifically, it mainly includes four steps: data preprocessing, dimension reduction using principal component analysis, sources separation using independent component analysis, and reconstruction after interference suppression. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed technique suppressed the interference effectively and even better compared with classical existing methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
681	Intelligent Quality of Service Aware Traffic Forwarding for Software-Defined Networking/Open Shortest Path First Hybrid Industrial Internet	Driven by the emerging advanced information and communication technologies, e.g., artificial intelligence, 5G wireless communications, big data analytics, etc., industrial Internet serves as a key enabling technology to realize intelligent manufacturing, and has been attracting considerable attentions from academia and industry. However, the traditional industrial networks can hardly satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements for some mission-critical industrial applications (e.g., fault detection, advanced control, remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, etc.) due to network heterogeneity, traffic congestion, dynamic end-to-end latency, reliability issues, and so on. The emerging software-defined networking (SDN) has been considered as a promising architecture to improve the QoS of industrial applications by flexibly decoupling the control and data planes to control the network behaviours centrally. Owing to economy and policy considerations, a realistic solution is to incrementally deploy SDN in industrial networks instead of fully replacing traditional industrial routers with SDN-enabled switches. In this article, we consider a hybrid Industrial network consisting of conventional routers (e.g., running OSPF protocol) and SDN-enabled switches (e.g., running OpenFlow protocol), and propose an intelligent QoS-aware forwarding strategy to improve the QoS of industrial applications, by utilizing a single path minimum cost forwarding scheme and a K-path partition algorithm for multipath forwarding. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only guarantees the QoS requirements of industrial services, but also efficiently utilizes bandwidth resources by balancing traffic load in the SDN/OSPF hybrid industrial Internet. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25
682	SaliencyGAN: Deep Learning Semisupervised Salient Object Detection in the Fog of IoT	In modern Internet of Things (IoT), visual analysis and predictions are often performed by deep learning models. Salient object detection (SOD) is a fundamental preprocessing for these applications. Executing SOD on the fog devices is a challenging task due to the diversity of data and fog devices. To adopt convolutional neural networks (CNN) on fog-cloud infrastructures for SOD-based applications, we introduce a semisupervised adversarial learning method in this article. The proposed model, named as SaliencyGAN, is empowered by a novel concatenated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with partially shared parameters. The backbone CNN can be chosen flexibly based on the specific devices and applications. In the meanwhile, our method uses both the labeled and unlabeled data from different problem domains for training. Using multiple popular benchmark datasets, we compared state-of-the-art baseline methods to our SaliencyGAN obtained with 10-100% labeled training data. SaliencyGAN gained performance comparable to the supervised baselines when the percentage of labeled data reached 30%, and outperformed the weakly supervised and unsupervised baselines. Furthermore, our ablation study shows that SaliencyGAN were more robust to the common 'mode missing' (or 'mode collapse') issue compared to the selected popular GAN models. The visualized ablation results have proved that SaliencyGAN learned a better estimation of data distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first IoT-oriented semisupervised SOD method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	60
683	Implementing AI as Cyber IoT Devices: The House Valuation Example	Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely utilized with artificial intelligence (AI). However, it requires substantial effort to integrate AI and big data with IoT. To mitigate this problem, AItalk was proposed. By treating AI as a cyber IoT device, we do not need to write code of the AI mechanism in the network applications, as traditional AI-based IoT applications did. This article describes how the AI tools such as scikit-learn and TensorLayer are accommodated as cyber IoT devices in AItalk, and extends AItalk for non-IoT applications. We use house valuation as an example to show how AItalk can flexibly include the factors that have significant impact on the house price. We show that by adding extra features other than housing profile features, the accuracy for the prediction (valuation) can be improved by 38%. We also investigated the communication overhead of the distributed AItalk structure, which is 3.7% for the computation of one house price valuation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
684	Concurrent Assessment of Process Operating Performance with Joint Static and Dynamic Analysis	Assessment of operating performance for industrial processes is critical to guarantee high productivity and low cost, under routine operating condition. In the traditional research works on assessment of operating performance, the static characteristics are fully investigated, but the dynamic characteristics are seldom explored. Actually, the dynamic characteristics are important to distinguish operating performance and indicate the regulating actions of controllers. This article presents a concurrent static and dynamic assessment (ConSDA) method for operating performance in terms of industrial processes under closed-loop control. The performance levels are distinguished from both static and dynamic aspects. Canonical variate analysis and slow feature analysis are combined to fully extract the static and dynamic features of a process to well characterize each performance level. An efficient assessing scheme using the Bayesian inference based criterion is developed to provide meticulous assessing result with meaningful physical interpretability and sensitive switching identification for performance levels. The efficacy is demonstrated through application to a numerical example and a three-phase flow process. The rates of accurately distinguishing the performance levels for ConSDA is over 95% for the two applications with strong dynamic properties. Meanwhile, the highest average accuracy rates of four other assessing methods is 87.0%. The comparison illustrates the superiority of ConSDA. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20

686	NELLY: Flow Detection Using Incremental Learning at the Server Side of SDN-Based Data Centers	The processing of big data generated by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) calls for the support of processing at the edge of the network, as well as at the cloud data centers. The equal-cost multipath, which is the default routing technique in the cloud data centers, can degrade the network performance when handling mouse and elephant flows. Such degradation of performance can compromise the support of the strict quality of service requirements of the IIoT over 5G networks. Novel techniques for scheduling the elephant flows can alleviate this problem. Recently, several approaches have incorporated machine learning techniques at the controller-side in software-defined data center networks (SDDCNs) to detect elephant flows. However, these approaches can produce heavy traffic overhead, low scalability, low accuracy, and high detection time. This article introduces the Network Elephants Learner and anaLYzer (NELLY), a novel and efficient method for applying incremental learning at the server side of SDDCNs to accurately and timely identify elephant flows with low traffic overhead. Incremental learning enables NELLY to adapt to varying network traffic conditions and perform continuous learning with limited memory resources. NELLY has been extensively evaluated using real traces and various incremental learning algorithms. Results show that NELLY is accurate and supports low classification time when using adaptive decision trees algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11

688	Fault Classification in High-Dimensional Complex Processes Using Semi-Supervised Deep Convolutional Generative Models	In complex industrial processes, process fault detection and classification constitute an important task for reducing production costs and improving product quality. Most existing methods for fault classification assume that sufficient labeled data are available for training. However, label acquisition is costly and laborious in practice, whereas abundant unlabeled data are often available. To make effective use of a large amount of unlabeled data for fault classification, we propose in this article a new approach using semi-supervised deep generative models, allowing the complex relationship between high-dimensional process data and the process status to be modeled. In particular, to consider the temporal correlation and intervariable correlation in multivariate time series process data collected from multiple sensors, we propose two semi-supervised deep generative models incorporating convolutional neural networks. The proposed models are assessed on data from the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process.

689	Online Generative Adversary Network Based Measurement Recovery in False Data Injection Attacks: A Cyber-Physical Approach	State estimation plays a critical role in maintaining operational stability of a power system, which is however vulnerable to attacks. False data injection (FDI) attacks can manipulate the state estimation results through tampering the measurement data. In this paper, a cyber-physical model is proposed to defend against FDI attacks. It judiciously integrates a physical model which captures ideal measurements, with a generative adversarial network (GAN) based data model which captures the deviations from ideal measurements. To improve computation efficiency of GAN, a new smooth training technique is developed, and an online adaptive window idea is explored to maintain the state estimation integrity in real time. The simulation results on IEEE 30-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate that our defense technique can accurately recover the state estimation data manipulated by FDI attacks. The resulting recovered measurements are sufficiently close to the true measurements, with the error lower than $1.5e^{-5}$ and $2e^{-2}$ p.u. in terms of voltage amplitude and phase angle, respectively. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	36

691	Achieving Intelligent Trust-Layer for Internet-of-Things via Self-Redactable Blockchain	The advances of artificial intelligence (AI) propels big data processing and transmission for Internet of Things (IoT), by capturing and structuring big data produced by heterogeneous devices. While applying blockchain to manage IoT devices and associated big data, the blockchain itself suffers from abuse of decentralization from anonymous users. Specifically, it has been utilized to facilitate black market trades and illegal activities. Ateniese et al. proposed using the chameleon hash (CH) to derive redactable blockchain (EuroS&P), which works by embedding a trapdoor in the basic hash function so that block content can be rewritten without causing major hard forks. In short, the redacted block hash remains unchanged. However, there is lacking intelligent design where any mistakes observed in the chain can be corrected universally and automatically. This creates disincentives to use redactable blockchain (RB) for managing big data or any data-driven business mainly due to ineffective chain redaction. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose the notion of the self-redactable blockchain (SRB) to support intelligent execution of chain redaction. Specifically, we propose the first revocable chameleon hash (RCH) to power RB. It enables an ephemeral trapdoor for finding collision without any co-operation. Periodical expiration is applied to committed hash and an ephemeral trapdoor to prevent any abuses of redaction power. We instantiate how to use our RCH to build SRB as an intelligent trust-layer for IoT. We also give a rigorous analysis as well as comprehensive experiments to validate our proposals. The evidence showed that our proposal is secure and acceptably efficient for IoT devices. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18

And an adaptive fuzzy neural network identifier, using the relevant process data, is designed to catch the nonlinear behaviors of WWTPs. Second, a transfer multiobjective optimization algorithm (TMOOA) is developed to obtain the optimal solutions of the conflicting control objectives. The major advantage of TMOOA is its low computational cost, which is realized by avoiding the computation of Pareto fronts. Third, the stability of MOPC has been given in detail.

694	Correlated Differential Privacy: Feature Selection in Machine Learning	Privacy preserving in machine learning is a crucial issue in industry informatics since data used for training in industries usually contain sensitive information. Existing differentially private machine learning algorithms have not considered the impact of data correlation, which may lead to more privacy leakage than expected in industrial applications. For example, data collected for traffic monitoring may contain some correlated records due to temporal correlation or user correlation. To fill this gap, in this article, we propose a correlation reduction scheme with differentially private feature selection considering the issue of privacy loss when data have correlation in machine learning tasks. The proposed scheme involves five steps with the goal of managing the extent of data correlation, preserving the privacy, and supporting accuracy in the prediction results. In this way, the impact of data correlation is relieved with the proposed feature selection scheme, and moreover the privacy issue of data correlation in learning is guaranteed. The proposed method can be widely used in machine learning algorithms, which provide services in industrial areas. Experiments show that the proposed scheme can produce better prediction results with machine learning tasks and fewer mean square errors for data queries compared to existing schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	27
695	Robust Scheduling of Hot Rolling Production by Local Search Enhanced Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm	Scheduling of a hot strip mill is an important decision problem in the steel manufacturing industry. Previous studies on the hot strip mill scheduling problem have mostly neglected the random factors in production. However, random variations in processing times are inevitable due to unpredictable delays and disturbances. In this article, we adopt a robust optimization approach to deal with the uncertainty in processing times. The advantage is that no assumption has to be made regarding the distribution of random data, and the obtained schedule will remain strictly feasible when the variations have not exceeded a predefined uncertainty set. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented to formulate the robust scheduling problem. Then, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, which combines ant colony system (ACS) and enhanced local search, is proposed to provide an efficient solution to the problem. Finally, extensive computational experiments involving both randomly generated and real-world instances have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm achieves optimality for small instances and outperforms two state-of-the-art metaheuristics when used to solve large instances. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	29

697	Bayesian Just-in-Time Learning and Its Application to Industrial Soft Sensing	Just-in-time learning (JITL), which can deal with both process nonlinearities and time-varying characteristics, has become a widely used tool for industrial soft sensing. High performance of JITL lies in selecting an accurate relevant sample set and developing a good base learner, which, however, still have some issues unresolved. In this article, a Bayesian JITL (BJTIL) is established to improve the performance of a JITL-based soft sensor in terms of relevant sample selection and base learner construction. The BJITL has dual implications. First, a semisupervised relevant sample selection strategy with a mixture of Mahalanobis distances based on the fully Bayesian Dirichlet process mixture model is proposed, such that both labeled and unlabeled samples can be exploited, and complicated non-Gaussian distributions (such as those with multipeaks or severe asymmetry) can be accounted for. Second, a weighted fully Bayesian Gaussian regression model with randomized mean and covariance is proposed as the base learner training algorithm so as to deal with the overfitting and numerical issues. Two real-world industrial processes are employed to evaluate the performance of the BJITL when it is applied to soft sensor development. The results demonstrate that the BJITL can achieve higher predictive accuracy in contrast with some state-of-the-art schemes for relevant sample selection and base learner construction. In addition, it is shown that the BJTIL can provide better predictive uncertainties. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19

Furthermore, we take advantages of the network representation learning technique on the vehicular ad hoc network for learning driver vectors. Finally, potential friends are recommended based on the similarity of driver vectors. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method has the best performance on friend recommendation compared with several state-of-The-Art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to recommend friends for taxi drivers based on vehicular ad hoc network representation learning. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
699	Multiview Learning for Subsurface Defect Detection in Composite Products: A Challenge on Thermographic Data Analysis	Nondestructive testing (NDT) is an economical way of detecting subsurface defects in composite products. Infrared thermography serves as a popular NDT method due to its high efficiency and low cost. However, defect identification by directly visualizing thermal images is difficult owing to the nonuniform background and noise. Recently, data analysis methods have been introduced to thermal image processing, including principal component analysis, which is known for its good performance in dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and noise reduction. However, most of these methods can only extract linear features. In this article, a multiview learning-based autoencoder, which can process not only nonlinear features but also sequential attributes, is utilized in thermographic data analysis. After extracting the low-dimensional features by multiview learning, a background elimination step is conducted to highlight the locations and shapes of the defects. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
700	Differentially private asynchronous federated learning for mobile edge computing in urban informatics	Driven by technologies such as mobile edge computing and 5G, recent years have witnessed the rapid development of urban informatics, where a large amount of data is generated. To cope with the growing data, artificial intelligence algorithms have been widely exploited. Federated learning is a promising paradigm for distributed edge computing, which enables edge nodes to train models locally without transmitting their data to a server. However, the security and privacy concerns of federated learning hinder its wide deployment in urban applications such as vehicular networks. In this article, we propose a differentially private asynchronous federated learning scheme for resource sharing in vehicular networks. To build a secure and robust federated learning scheme, we incorporate local differential privacy into federated learning for protecting the privacy of updated local models. We further propose a random distributed update scheme to get rid of the security threats led by a centralized curator. Moreover, we perform the convergence boosting in our proposed scheme by updates verification and weighted aggregation. We evaluate our scheme on three real-world datasets. Numerical results show the high accuracy and efficiency of our proposed scheme, whereas preserve the data privacy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	126
701	Secure and Lightweight Authentication Scheme for Smart Metering Infrastructure in Smart Grid	In this article, a secure and lightweight authentication scheme, which provides trust, anonymity, and mutual authentication, with reduced energy, communicational, and computational overheads, is proposed for resource-constrained smart meters (SMs). The designed mutual authentication-based key agreement protocol leverages the advantages of fully hashed menezes-qu-vanstone key exchange mechanism along with Elliptic curve cryptography and one-way hash functions. Moreover, it allows to securely establish and verify the trust between the two communicating parties, i.e., SMs and neighbourhood area network gateway. These entities communicate over the insecure channel and form an important component of the smart metering infrastructure. Furthermore, extensive performance evaluation validates the supremacy of the designed protocol over the state-of-the-art in furnishing higher security features with minimal communicational and computational overheads. The obtained results also reflect that the proposed protocol is fit for implementation on resource-constrained SMs as it leads to minimal energy consumption. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	44
702	BPAS: Blockchain-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Authentication System for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks	If all vehicles are connected together through a wireless communication channel, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) can support a wide range of real-time traffic information services, such as intelligent routing, weather monitoring, emergency call, etc. However, the accuracy and credibility of the transmitted messages among the VANETs are of paramount importance as life may depend on it. In this article we introduce a novel framework called blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving authentication system (BPAS) that provides authentication automatically in VANETs and preserves vehicle privacy at the same time. This design is highly efficient and scalable. It does not require any online registration centre (except for system initialization and vehicle registration), and allows conditional tracing and dynamic revocation of misbehaving vehicles. In this article, we conduct an in-depth security analysis and a comprehensive performance evaluation (which is based on the Hyperledger Fabric platform) for our proposed framework. The results demonstrate that our framework is an efficient solution for the development of a decentralized authentication system in VANETs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	93
703	Secure Data Storage and Recovery in Industrial Blockchain Network Environments	The massive redundant data storage and communication in network 4.0 environments have issues of low integrity, high cost, and easy tampering. To address these issues, in this article, a secure data storage and recovery scheme in the blockchain-based network is proposed by improving the decentration, tampering-proof, real-time monitoring, and management of storage systems, as such design supports the dynamic storage, fast repair, and update of distributed data in the data storage system of industrial nodes. A local regenerative code technology is used to repair and store data between failed nodes while ensuring the privacy of user data. That is, as the data stored are found to be damaged, multiple local repair groups constructed by vector code can simultaneously yet efficiently repair multiple distributed data storage nodes. Based on the unique chain storage structure, such as data consensus mechanism and smart contract, the storage structure of blockchain distributed coding not only quickly repair the nearby local regenerative codes in the blockchain but also reduce the resource overhead in the data storage process of industrial nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves the repair rate of multinode data by 9% and data storage rate increased by 8.6%, indicating to be promising with good security and real-time performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	130
704	Observer-Driven Charging of Supercapacitors	Cell balancing is crucial for charging supercapacitor cells to prevent cells from over-charging. Most existing cell-balancing charging methods typically adopt an output feedback control, i.e., the terminal voltages of cells are directly utilized in the controller design. One limitation of these methods is the voltage drop effect when the charging is terminated, which degrades the system capacity and results in cell imbalance. To address this challenge, in this article, we propose an observer-driven charging method for supercapacitors. The switched resistor circuit is applied and is further modeled using the switched systems theory, where the RC model of cells is considered. The communication interactions among cells is modeled using the graph theory. A switching Luenberger observer is designed to estimate the voltage of the equivalent capacitor of each cell, and a consensus-based switching control law is designed to charge and balance supercapacitors. The closed-loop system model is derived using the block diagram. A laboratory testbed has been built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed charging method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively alleviate the voltage drop effect when compared with existing charging methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
705	Distributed Electric Vehicles Charging Management with Social Contribution Concept	This article proposes a charging management of electric vehicles (EVs) with a newly presented EV social contribution. The EV charging problem is represented by a generalized Nash equilibrium game where each individual EV tries to minimize its charging cost while satisfying its own charging requirements and respecting the charging facility constraints. The individual EV features a social behavior to potentially contribute in shifting its charging schedule from specific intervals that have insufficient charging power. This shift in the EV schedule will allow more charging power to other EVs that admit stricter charging requirements, i.e., intervals and demands. In this way, the contributed EVs socially help others in reducing their charging costs, which is particularly important during the overload cases in the system. The proposed solution is reached iteratively in a distributed way utilizing the consensus network and found based on the receding horizon optimization framework. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed social contribution in the charging management for reducing the charging cost of EVs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
706	A Sine-Wave Heating Circuit for Automotive Battery Self-Heating at Subzero Temperatures	Self-heating is of extreme importance for improving the available capacity and lifetime of lithium-ion batteries in cold climates. However, few attempts have been done to achieve effective onboard self-heating for the batteries in electric vehicles. This paper derives a high-frequency sine-wave (SW) heater based on resonant LC converters to self-heat the automotive batteries at low-temperatures without the need of external heaters. To be specific, an interleaved-parallel topology is introduced to double the heating speed without extra damages to batteries compared to the single heater. Further, a corresponding thermoelectric model is developed to provide guidance for the optimal design of the parameters in the proposed SW heater. Experimental results show that with a high-frequency sinusoidal current motivated by the proposed heater, lithium-ion batteries could be effectively self-heated by the ohmic-loss and electrochemical heat. Moreover, the heating time could be significantly shortened through decreasing the characteristic impedance √L/C or increasing the ac-heating frequency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	38
707	Cooperative Management for PV/ESS-Enabled Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: A Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach	This article proposes a novel multiagent deep reinforcement learning method for the energy management of distributed electric vehicle charging stations with a solar photovoltaic system and energy storage system. In the literature, the conventional method is to calculate the optimal electric vehicle charging schedule in a centralized manner. However, in general, the centralized approach is not realistic under certain environments where the system operators for multiple electric vehicle charging stations handle dynamically varying data, such as the status of the energy storage system and electric vehicle-related information. Therefore, this article proposes a method that can compute the scheduling solutions of multiple electric vehicle charging stations in a distributed manner while handling run-time time-varying dynamic data. As shown in the data-intensive performance evaluation, it can be observed that the proposed method achieves a desirable performance in terms of reducing the operation costs of electric vehicle charging stations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	59
708	A 7-Cell, Stackable, Li-Ion Monitoring and Active/Passive Balancing IC with In-Built Cell Balancing Switches for Electric and Hybrid Vehicles	Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid EVs need stacked lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells to achieve the required high voltage (HV). Cell monitoring and balancing in a stackable battery system is necessary to compensate for accumulative discharge mechanisms and keep the individual cells in the same state of charge. In this article, an integrated circuit consisting of a 12-bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter is designed to measure, monitor, and balance Li-ion cell voltages with a measured accuracy of ±7 mV. These stacked cells are compared simultaneously with a reference voltage to balance the cells. Balancing switches for charging/discharging of the cells are integrated within the circuit to support a balancing current of up to 100 mA, which reduces the number of external components for balancing significantly. The circuit supports both active and passive balancing. A synchronous voltage mode level shifting circuit is implemented for communication between the stacked integrated circuits (ICs) to eliminate external components. Internal linear drop outs (LDOs) (3 and 5 V) power most of the blocks in the IC. The design is fabricated in HV 0.35 μm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and found to consume a quiescent current of 17 μA. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
709	Battery Aging Assessment for Real-World Electric Buses Based on Incremental Capacity Analysis and Radial Basis Function Neural Network	Accurate battery aging prediction is essential for ensuring efficient, reliable, and safe operation of battery systems in electric vehicle application. This article presents a novel battery aging assessment method based on the incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model. The RBFNN model is used to depict the relationship between battery aging level and its influencing factors based on real-world operation datasets of electric city transit buses. The ICA method together with the Gaussian window (GW) filter method is used to derive the peak values of IC curves which are utilized to represent battery aging levels, and the support vector regression (SVR) method is used in several scenarios for data preprocessing. The considered influencing factors include accumulated mileage of vehicles and initial charging state-of-charge (SOC), average charging temperature, average charging current, and average operating temperature of battery systems. The datasets collected from real-world electric city buses are used for RBFNN model training, validation, and test. The results show that an average prediction error of 4.00% is reached, and the derived model has a confidential interval of 92% with the prediction accuracy of 90%.

710	Health-Aware Multiobjective Optimal Charging Strategy with Coupled Electrochemical-Thermal-Aging Model for Lithium-Ion Battery	Battery fast charging strategies have gained an increasing interest toward the convenience of battery applications but may unduly degrade or damage the batteries. To harness these competing objectives, including safety, lifespan, and charging time, in this article, we propose a novel health-aware multiobjective optimal charging strategy to simultaneously shorten the charging time and relieve the battery degradation. The multiobjective optimal charging problem is formulated based on a coupled electrochemical-thermal-aging battery model. Constraints are explicitly imposed on physically meaningful state variables to avoid hazardous operations. Charging duration and battery aging process are well traded-off. Strategies for minimum-time and health-aware fast charging are investigated using different input current bounds, subject to both side reaction and temperature constraints. The experimental results validate that the presented multiobjective health-aware optimal charging algorithm is capable of reducing the charging time from its benchmarks largely without sacrificing the state-of-health of the battery. © 2019 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	37
711	Multiobjective 3-D Topology Optimization of Next-Generation Wireless Data Center Network	As one of the next-generation network technologies for data centers, wireless data center networks have important research significance. Smart architecture optimization and management are vital for wireless data center networks. With the ever-increasing demand for data center resources, the deployment of the data servers are on the rise. However, traditional wired links among servers are expensive and inflexible. Benefitting from the development of intelligent optimization and other techniques, this article studies a high-speed wireless topology for wireless data center networks. A radio propagation model based on a heat map is constructed. The line-of-sight issue and the interference problem are also discussed. By simultaneously considering the objectives of coverage, propagation intensity, and interference intensity, as well as the constraint of connectivity, the topology optimization problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. To seek the solutions, several state-of-the-art serial multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), as well as parallel MOEAs, are employed. Prior knowledge is preferred for the grouping, and parameter adaptation is conducted in the distributed parallel algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the parallel MOEAs perform effectively in the optimization results and efficiently in time consumption. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	69
712	Energy-Efficient and Trustworthy Data Collection Protocol Based on Mobile Fog Computing in Internet of Things	The tremendous growth of interconnected things/devices in the whole world advances to the new paradigm, i.e., Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT use sensor-based embedded systems to interact with others, providing a wide range of applications and services to upper-level users. Undoubtedly, the data collected by the underlying IoTs are the basis of the upper-layer decision and the foundation for all the applications, which requires efficient energy protocols. Moreover, if the collected data are erroneous and untrustworthy, the data protection and application becomes an unrealistic goal, which further leads to unnecessary energy cost. However, the traditional methods cannot solve this problem efficiently and trustworthily. To achieve this goal, in this paper we design a novel energy-efficient and trustworthy protocol based on mobile fog computing. By establishing a trust model on fog elements to evaluate the sensor nodes, the mobile data collection path with the largest utility value is generated, which can avoid visiting unnecessary sensors and collecting untrustworthy data.

713	Authentic Caller: Self-Enforcing Authentication in a Next-Generation Network	The Internet of Things (IoT) or the cyber-physical system (CPS) is the network of connected devices, things, and people that collect and exchange information using the emerging telecommunication networks (4G, 5G IP-based LTE). These emerging telecommunication networks can also be used to transfer critical information between the source and destination, informing the control system about the outage in the electrical grid, or providing information about the emergency at the national express highway. This sensitive information requires authorization and authentication of source and destination involved in the communication. To protect the network from unauthorized access and to provide authentication, the telecommunication operators have to adopt the mechanism for seamless verification and authorization of parties involved in the communication. Currently, the next-generation telecommunication networks use a digest-based authentication mechanism, where the call-processing engine of the telecommunication operator initiates the challenge to the request-initiating client or caller, which is being solved by the client to prove his credentials. However, the digest-based authentication mechanisms are vulnerable to many forms of known attacks, e.g., the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and the password guessing attack. Furthermore, the digest-based systems require extensive processing overheads. Several public-key infrastructure (PKI)-based and identity-based schemes have been proposed for the authentication and key agreements. However, these schemes generally require a smart card to hold long-term private keys and authentication credentials. In this article, we propose a novel self-enforcing authentication protocol for the session-initiation-protocol-based next-generation network, based on a low-entropy shared password without relying on any PKI or the trusted third party system. The proposed system shows effective resistance against various attacks, e.g., MITM, replay attack, password guessing attack, etc. We analyze the security properties of the proposed scheme in comparison to the state of the art. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
714	Solving Overstay and Stochasticity in PEV Charging Station Planning with Real Data	This article studies optimal plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging station planning, with consideration for the 'overstay' problem. Today, public PEV charging station utilization is typically around 15%. When un-utilized, the chargers are either idle or occupied by a fully charged PEV that has not departed. We call this 'overstay.' This motivates a strategy for increasing utilization by interchanging fully charged PEVs with those waiting for service-an issue which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Thus, this article studies the PEV charging station planning problem taking strategic interchange into account. To our best understanding, this has not been studied in the literature. With interchange, the objective is to enhance the charger utilization rate and, thus, reduce the number of chargers. This potentially reduces the capital investment and operational cost. A novel power/energy aggregation model is proposed, and a chance-constrained stochastic programming planning model with interchange is developed for a public charging station to incorporate customer demand uncertainties. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that incorporating strategic interchange operation can significantly decrease the number of chargers, enhance utilization and economic efficiency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
715	Optimal Sizing and Energy Management for Cost-Effective PEV Hybrid Energy Storage Systems	In battery/ultracapacitor (UC) hybrid energy storage systems (HESS), sizing and energy management strategies are crucial, which determine the system cost and performance. However, research on these two problems in a coupled manner for plug-in electric vehicles is still immature. This article aims at resolving this issue in the perspective of minimizing the average operating cost. Both manufacturing cost and system end-of-life timing are incorporated. A quantitative battery degradation model is employed to evaluate the battery dynamic capacity loss and cycle life. Dynamic programming algorithm is then deployed to achieve optimal power distribution between battery and UC. Furthermore, the power management and HESS optimal sizing strategies are unified into a single cost-minimization problem. Combining those efforts, the optimal size of the HESS with minimized average operating cost is solved by simulated annealing method. Optimization results illustrate that a minimum cost of 15.52 USD is achieved with 72 UC cells and 7100 battery cells. A large set of simulation data has proved the optimality of the optimization results. Compared with the battery-only solution, the proposed solution demonstrates 11.9% cost reduction and 21.7% battery cycle life extension under the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule. Moreover, the temperature rise of the battery is reduced by 31.1%. Finally, based on the optimal results, the energy management strategy is extended to fit real-time applications by utilizing Markov chain and stochastic dynamic programming. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	35
716	Integrated Motion and Powertrain Predictive Control of Intelligent Fuel Cell/Battery Hybrid Vehicles	This article considers intelligent fuel cell/battery hybrid vehicles (FCHVs) that can make autonomous decisions at both the vehicle and powertrain levels. Since the vehicle and powertrain level dynamics are inherently integrated, we propose an integrated motion and powertrain model predictive control approach for intelligent FCHVs by jointly optimizing the vehicle acceleration and fuel cell current. The control goals are to achieve vehicle mobility, minimal hydrogen consumption, and battery state-of-charge maintenance within system constraints. The main challenge in an integrated control is that the electric motor can operate in both propelling and generating modes coupling with vehicle and powertrain states. This hybrid operation is handled by the mixed logical dynamical modeling resulting in a mixed integer nonlinear control problem. To relieve the possible heavy computational burden, two simplification approaches are proposed: hierarchical control and successive linearizations. Two standard driving cycles and a typical vehicle cruising scenario are employed to test the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control algorithms. Simulation results show that the hierarchical linear control is more suitable for real-time applications with comparable control performance with that of the integrated control. However, additional constraints must be carefully designed to compensate for the ignored coupling dynamics and constraints. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15
717	A Profitable and Energy-Efficient Cooperative Fog Solution for IoT Services	Fog-to-fog communication has been introduced to deliver services to clients with minimal reliance on the cloud through resource and capability sharing of cooperative fogs. Current solutions assume full cooperation among the fogs to deliver simple and composite services. Realistically, each fog might belong to a different network operator or service provider and thus will not participate in any form of collaboration unless self-monetary profit is incurred. In this paper, we introduce a fog collaboration approach for simple and complex multimedia service delivery to cloud subscribers while achieving shared profit gains for the cooperating fogs. The proposed work dynamically creates short-term service-level agreements (SLAs) offered to cloud subscribers for service delivery while maximizing user satisfaction and fog profit gains. The solution provides a learning mechanism that relies on online and offline simulation results to build guaranteed workflows for new service requests. The configuration parameters of the short-term SLAs are obtained using a modified tabu-based search mechanism that uses previous solutions when selecting new optimal choices. Performance evaluation results demonstrate significant gains in terms of service delivery success rate, service quality, reduced power consumption for fog and cloud datacenters, and increased fog profits. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	52

To this end, we introduce the electrode-level battery state of health (eSOH) estimation problem with open-circuit voltage (OCV) data. In real-world applications, collecting the full-range OCV data is difficult since the battery is not deeply discharged. When data is limited, the estimation accuracy deteriorates. In this article, we quantify the uncertainty of the electrode parameter estimation with partial data based on the Cramer-Rao bound and confidence interval. By introducing a voltage constraint in the estimation problem, the positive electrode parameters can be estimated with sufficient accuracy over a wide range of state of charge. However, the estimation accuracy of the negative electrode parameters is more sensitive to the depth of discharge. The proposed framework can be used as a guideline for selecting proper data windows and understanding the impact on parameter estimation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

However, a large number of volatile distributed generation power systems in the community are connected to the grid. It is difficult to stabilize and efficiently interact with fragmented and isolated energy management systems, and it is difficult to meet energy management needs in terms of low-carbon emissions, stability, and intelligence. Therefore, by considering operation costs, pollution control costs, energy stability, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, this article proposes a regional energy supply model called community energy Internet and builds a low-carbon community energy adaptive management model for smart services. Then, to address energy supply instability, an adaptive feedback control mechanism developed based on model predictive control is introduced to adapt to the changing environment. Finally, a long short-term memory-recurrent neural network-based Tabu search is introduced to prevent the multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm from easily falling into a local optimum. The simulation results show that the proposed model can effectively realize the optimal allocation of energy, which solves the problem of fragmented energy islands caused by distributed power access. This method has quality of service benefits for users, such as cost, time, and stability, and realizes wide interconnections, high intelligence, and low-carbon efficiency of community energy management. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
720	On the Design of a Flexible Delegation Model for the Internet of Things Using Blockchain	The Internet of things (IoT) presents new opportunities and challenges due to its scale and dynamic nature. One significant challenge for the IoT is the need for security, in particular access control solutions, that are designed to meet the characteristics of these systems. Delegation of rights, from one entity to another, is a crucial component of an access control system. The IoT requires a secure, flexible, and fine-grained delegation model. While there has been considerable work in the area of delegation, much of it assumes a centralized, well-resourced system and these solutions have limited capacity in the context of the IoT. Where delegation models for the IoT have been proposed they typically provide only coarse-grained control over the delegation of rights. Moreover, many of them require a centralized trusted authority, which can suffer from a single-point failure and is not an ideal base for a large and dynamic system like the IoT. In this paper, we propose an identity-less, asynchronous, and decentralized delegation model for the IoT based on blockchain technology. We describe system components, architecture, and key aspects related to the security of the system. We use attributes to validate an entity rather than depending upon unique identities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model through use-case examples and analyze the performance with a proof of concept testbed implementation using Ethereum private blockchain. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	29

With possibly millions of such vehicles operating across the smart cities, smart grid energy providers can be directly impacted by the charging of EV batteries. In order to reduce this impact and optimize energy saving, in this article, we propose a coordinated model for scheduling the plug-in of EVs for charging and discharging energy. The model is based on a new decentralized Fog architecture for smart grid in order to reduce the completion and communication delay of EV energy demand scheduling. To enhance the scheduling of EV demands and predict the future energy flows, we propose a plug-in system of EVs based on calendar planning. We develop a mathematical formalism based on Markov chains using a multipriority queuing theory with cut-off discipline in order to reduce the waiting time to plug-in. We implement three planning algorithms in order to assign priority levels and then optimize the plug-in time into each EV public supply station. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that proposes a model that tries to save energy by planning the plug-in of EVs using a cut-off priority queuing model and a decentralized Fog architecture. We evaluate the performances of our solution via extensive simulations using a realistic energy loads from the city of Toronto, and we compare it with other recent works. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13

723	Energy-Efficient Over-the-Air Computation Scheme for Densely Deployed IoT Networks	In this article, we propose a spatial sampling approach to reduce energy consumption for over-the-air (function) computation (AirComp) scheme by utilizing the cross-correlations among sensor readings. Since the conventional AirComp scheme leads to a reduction in total transmission time and latency thanks to the joint communication and computation processes, it is especially well-suited to Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring systems. AirComp lets simultaneous transmissions of all nodes by exploiting the superposition property of wireless channel; however, it does not overcome the high energy consumption paradigm, which is a fundamental problem of densely deployed IoT monitoring systems. We present a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation scheme while a small number of observations are available for densely deployed networks. The proposed MMSE estimator provides a significant mean squared error improvement with reducing energy consumption compared to the conventional estimator. Since the network lifetime of IoT monitoring systems can be almost doubled, the proposed estimator provides flexibility for the dense deployment of nodes.

As an important energy system that is closely related to people's lives, its security and stability is one of the cores of its development. With the access of a large number of distributed devices, the structure of the power system has changed greatly. The addition of various forms of energy network, distributed equipment, and energy storage equipment has made it more difficult for the energy Internet to achieve the coordination among and control over these devices. Regardless of the fluctuation of the power load and the sudden change of the thermal load, problems such as energy network failure and demand will affect the security and stability of the energy Internet. Traditional energy systems are independent of one another, while integrated energy systems include subsystems, such as the power system, thermal system, and natural gas system, which can complement one another in planning and operation.

725	Core Temperature Estimation for Self-Heating Automotive Lithium-Ion Batteries in Cold Climates	The onboard battery self-heaters are employed to improve the performance and lifetime of the automotive lithium-ion batteries under cold climates. The battery performance is determined by the core temperature which is significantly higher than the surface temperature during the fast self-heating, while only the surface temperature can be directly measured. By estimating the core temperature to monitor the self-heating condition, the heating time and the energy consumption can be improved. However, the high-frequency heating current and the time-variant battery impedance cannot be measured in real time by a low-sampling-rate battery management system, so that the regular core temperature estimation methods are not applicable during the self-heating. To solve the issues, an online core temperature estimation algorithm based on the lumped thermal-electrical model is developed for the onboard ac self-heater. By implementing an extended state observer to compensate for the effect of the parameter uncertainties, the core temperature can be accurately detected even with the unknown internal resistance and root mean square (RMS) heating current. The experimental validation of 18 650 lithium-ion batteries shows that the core temperature estimation error is within only 1.2 °C. As a result, the self-heating time and energy consumption can be reduced by 50%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15
726	Shipping 4.0: Security Requirements for the Cyber-Enabled Ship	The cyber-enabled ship (C-ES) is either an autonomous or a remotely controlled vessel which relies on interconnected cyber physical-systems for its operations. Such systems are not well protected against cyberattacks. Considering the criticality of the functions that such systems provide, it is important to address their security challenges, thereby ensuring the ship's safe voyage. In this article, we leverage the maritime architectural framework reference architecture to analyze and describe the environment of the C-ES. We then apply the Secure Tropos methodology to systematically elicit the security requirements of the three most vulnerable cyber-physical systems (CPSs) onboard a C-ES, namely the automatic identification system (AIS), the electronic chart display information system, and the global maritime distress and safety system. The outcome is a set of cyber-security requirements for the C-ES ecosystem in general and these systems in particular. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	17
727	Privacy-Enhanced Data Collection Based on Deep Learning for Internet of Vehicles	The development of smart cities and deep learning technology is changing our physical world to a cyber world. As one of the main applications, the Internet of Vehicles has been developing rapidly. However, privacy leakage and delay problem for data collection remain as the key concerns behind the fast development of the cyber intelligence technologies. If the original data collected are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, it will bring huge load pressure and delay to the network communication. Moreover, during this process, it will lead to the leakage of data privacy. To this end, in this article we design a data collection and preprocessing scheme based on deep learning, which adopts the semisupervised learning algorithm of data augmentation and label guessing. Data filtering is performed at the edge layer, and a large amount of similar data and irrelevant data are cleared. If the edge device cannot process some complex data independently, it will send the processed and reliable data to the cloud for further processing, which maximizes the protection of user privacy. Our method significantly reduces the amount of data uploaded to the cloud, and meanwhile protects the user's data privacy effectively. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	64
728	A Novel Shortcut Addition Algorithm with Particle Swarm for Multisink Internet of Things	The Internet of Things integrates a large number of distributed nodes to collect or transmit data. When the network scale increases, individuals use multiple sink nodes to construct the network. This increases the complexity of the network and leads to significant challenges in terms of the existing methods with respect to the aspect of data forwarding and collection. In order to address the issue, this paper proposes a Shortcut Addition strategy based on the Particle Swarm algorithm (SAPS) for multisink network. It constructs a network topology with multiple sinks based on a small-world network. In the SAPS, we create a fitness function by combining the average path length and load of the sink node, to evaluate the quality of a particle. Subsequently, crossover and mutation are used to update the particles to determine the optimal solution. The simulation results indicate that the SAPS is superior both to the greedy model with small world and the load-balanced multigateway aware long link addition strategy in terms of the average path length, load balance, and number of added shortcuts. © 2019 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
729	DeepReS: A Deep Learning-Based Video Summarization Strategy for Resource-Constrained Industrial Surveillance Scenarios	The exponential growth in the production of video contents in different industries causes an urgent need for effective video summarization (VS) techniques, in order to get an optimal storage and preservation of key information in the video. Compared to other domains, industrial videos are more challenging to process, as they usually contain diverse and complex events, which make their online processing a difficult task. In this article, we introduce an online system for intelligent video capturing, coarse and fine redundancy removal, and summary generation. First, we capture video data through resource-constrained devices in an industrial Internet of Things network, equipped with vision sensors and apply coarse redundancy removal through the comparison of low-level features. Second, we transmit the resulting frames to the cloud for detailed analysis, where sequential features are extracted for the selection of candidate keyframes. Finally, we refine the candidate keyframes in order to discriminate those with maximum information as part of the summary. The key contributions of this article include the coarse and fine refining of video data implemented over resource-restricted devices and the presentation of important data in the form of a summary.

730	Balancing Privacy and Accountability for Industrial Mortgage Management	Industrial mortgage enables companies to acquire loan for business venture or investment purposes by pledging their industrial assets to financial institutions. To prevent double-mortgage fraud of borrowers, information exchange among different financial institutions is necessary. On the other hand, it results in the privacy leakage of borrowers. In this article, we construct a blockchain-based accountable and privacy-preserving industrial mortgage scheme (BAPIM). BAPIM enables financial institutions to share the mortgage data of borrowers in an efficient and secure manner, that achieves the borrower identity privacy and accountability at the same time. Specifically, borrower identity is concealed on the blockchain by anonymous identity credential, while financial institutions can still uncover the identity of a misbehaving borrower if he pledges the same asset for multiple mortgages. We demonstrate that BAPIM achieves the desirable security properties and has high computational efficiency, so as to be suitable for the industrial mortgage management. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
731	An Efficient and Compacted DAG-Based Blockchain Protocol for Industrial Internet of Things	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been widely used in many fields. Meanwhile, blockchain is considered promising to address the issues of the IIoT. However, the current blockchains have a limited throughput. In this article, we devise an efficient and secure blockchain protocol compacted directed acyclic graph (CoDAG) based on a compacted directed acyclic graph, where blocks are organized in levels and width. New-generated blocks in the CoDAG will be placed appropriately and point to those in the previous level, making it a well-connected channel. Transactions in the network will be confirmed in a deterministic period, and the CoDAG keeps a simple data structure at the same time. We also illustrate the attack strategies by adversary, and it is proved that our protocols are resistant to these attacks. Furthermore, we design a CoDAG-based IIoT architecture to improve the efficiency of the IIoT system. Experimental results show that the CoDAG achieves 164× Bitcoin's throughput and 77× Ethererum's throughput. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	41
732	Detection and Mitigation of False Data Injection Attacks in Networked Control Systems	In networked control systems (NCS), agents participating in a network share their data with others to work together. When agents share their data, they can naturally expose the NCS to layers of faults and cyber-attacks, which can contribute to the propagation of error from one agent/area to another within the system. One common type of attack in which adversaries corrupt information within a NCS is called a false data injection (FDI) attack. This article proposes a control scheme, which enables a NCS to detect and mitigate FDI attacks and, at the same time, compensate for measurement noise and process noise. Furthermore, the developed controller is designed to be robust to unknown inputs. The algorithm incorporates a Kalman filter as an observer to estimate agents' states. We also develop a neural network (NN) architecture to detect and respond to any anomalies caused by FDI attacks. The weights of the NN are updated using an extended Kalman filter, which significantly improves the accuracy of FDI detection. A simulation of the results is provided, which illustrates satisfactory performance of the developed method to accurately detect and respond to FDI attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42
733	Improvement of the DPoS Consensus Mechanism in Blockchain Based on Vague Sets	United Nations security council resolutions are voted on by fifteen members of the security council. A resolution will be deemed to be adopted if more than nine of the member states adopt it and all five permanent members do not use the veto. The five permanent members can vote yes, no, and abstain against a resolution. The vague set can be explained intuitively with the voting model, indicating the three conditions for voting. Which are favor, against, and abstention. When the agent nodes were selected by the consensus mechanism of delegated proof of stake (DPoS), the voting node can only vote support instead of against and abstention, and there are no penalties for malicious nodes. Besides, there is no clear method to select the agent node if the votes obtained by the last agent node are the same as the votes cast by others. This article puts forward a kind of vague set to improve DPoS consensus mechanism. Just like how human elections are held, this method allows each node to vote for the agent node. This is a fair and effective way of selecting agent node when alternate nodes are of the same value, it improves the security and fairness of blockchain, reduces the probability that malicious nodes will be selected as agent nodes. We prove that the maximum probability of nodes after the vote of the fuzzy membership degree is 0.5. The feasibility and effectiveness of the improved consensus mechanism is verified by examples. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	41
734	BeCome: Blockchain-Enabled Computation Offloading for IoT in Mobile Edge Computing	Benefiting from the real-time processing ability of edge computing, computing tasks requested by smart devices in the Internet of Things are offloaded to edge computing devices (ECDs) for implementation. However, ECDs are often overloaded or underloaded with disproportionate resource requests. In addition, during the process of task offloading, the transmitted information is vulnerable, which can result in data incompleteness. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-enabled computation offloading method, named BeCome, is proposed in this article. Blockchain technology is employed in edge computing to ensure data integrity. Then, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III is adopted to generate strategies for balanced resource allocation. Furthermore, simple additive weighting and multicriteria decision making are utilized to identify the optimal offloading strategy. Finally, performance evaluations of BeCome are given through simulation experiments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	175

Benefits of applying edge computing is an adoptable complementarity for cloud computing; blockchain is an alternative for constructing transparent secure environment for data storage/governance. Instead of using these two techniques independently, in this article, we propose a novel approach that integrates IoT with edge computing and blockchain, which is called blockchain-based Internet of Edge model. The proposed model, designed for a scalable and controllable IoT system, sufficiently exploits advantages of edge computing and blockchain to establish a privacy-preserving mechanism while considering other constraints, such as energy cost. We implement experiment evaluations running on Ethereum.

736	Blockchain and Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserved Data Sharing in Industrial IoT	The rapid increase in the volume of data generated from connected devices in industrial Internet of Things paradigm, opens up new possibilities for enhancing the quality of service for the emerging applications through data sharing. However, security and privacy concerns (e.g., data leakage) are major obstacles for data providers to share their data in wireless networks. The leakage of private data can lead to serious issues beyond financial loss for the providers. In this article, we first design a blockchain empowered secure data sharing architecture for distributed multiple parties. Then, we formulate the data sharing problem into a machine-learning problem by incorporating privacy-preserved federated learning. The privacy of data is well-maintained by sharing the data model instead of revealing the actual data. Finally, we integrate federated learning in the consensus process of permissioned blockchain, so that the computing work for consensus can also be used for federated training. Numerical results derived from real-world datasets show that the proposed data sharing scheme achieves good accuracy, high efficiency, and enhanced security. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	331
737	How Does CSMA/CA Affect the Performance and Security in Wireless Blockchain Networks	The impact of communication transmission delay on the original blockchain, has not been well considered and studied since it is primarily designed in stable wired communication environment with high communication capacity. However, in a wireless scenario, due to the scarcity of spectrum resource, a blockchain user may have to compete for wireless channel to broadcast transactions following media access control (MAC) mechanism. As a result, the communication transmission delay may be significant and pose a bottleneck on the blockchain system performance and security. To facilitate blockchain applications in wireless industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs), this article aims to investigate whether the widely used MAC mechanism, carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), is suitable for wireless blockchain networks or not. Based on tangle, as an example to analyze the system performance in term of confirmation delay, transaction per second and transaction loss probability by considering the impact of queueing and transmission delay caused by CSMA/CA. Next, a stochastic model is proposed to analyze the security issue taking into account the malicious double-spending attack. Simulation results provide valuable insights when running blockchain in wireless network, the performance would be limited by the traditional CSMA/CA protocol. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the probability of launching a successful double-spending attack would be affected by CSMA/CA as well. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23

In addition, a PH selection scheme is introduced to provide an incentive for vehicles to be PHs and maintain the dynamic update of platoons. Next, a smart contract is employed to enable the payment based on a blockchain between the PH and platoon members (PMs), avoiding the malicious and false payments. The numerical results show that the platoon model is superior to the individual driving model in terms of fuel consumption. The comparison between carpooling and noncarpooling modes within the platoon shows that our model has a better performance in terms of PH revenue and PM's service charge. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	43

However, the existing mobile crowdsensing models are mostly based on a centralized platform, which is not fully trusted in reality and results in the existence of fraud and other security problems. Furthermore, the data quality collected through crowdsensing is varied, and the location privacy is difficult to guarantee, especially at the worker selection stage. To solve these two problems, an effective blockchain-based location-privacy-preserving crowdsensing model, CrowdBLPS, is proposed in this article. First, the idea of a blockchain is introduced into this model. The decentralized structure and the consensus approach are applied to realize the nonrepudiation and nontampering of information. Second, to improve the data sensing quality and protect worker privacy, a two-stage approach, including the preregistration stage and the final selection stage, is proposed. Finally, we further implement a prototype on the Ethereum public testing network, and the experimental results show the feasibility, availability, and reliability of CrowdBLPS. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	38
741	Energy-Efficient Multi-task Multi-access Computation Offloading Via NOMA Transmission for IoTs	Driven by the explosive growth in computation-intensive applications in future 5G networks and industries, mobile edge computing (MEC), which enables smart terminals (STs) to offload their computation workloads to nearby edge servers (ESs) in radio access networks, has attracted increasing attention. In this article, we investigate the energy-efficient multitask multiaccess MEC via nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Exploiting NOMA, an ST with multiple tasks can offload the respective computation workloads of different tasks to different ESs simultaneously. To study this problem, we adopt a two-step approach. Specifically, we first consider a given task-ES assignment and formulate a joint optimization of the tasks' computation offloading, local computation-resource allocation, and the NOMA-transmission duration, with the objective of minimizing the ST's total energy consumption for completing all tasks. Next, based on the optimal offloading solution for the given task-ES assignment, we further investigate how to properly assign different tasks to the ESs for further minimizing the ST's total energy consumption. For both the formulated problems, we propose efficient algorithms to compute the respective solutions. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. The results also show that our proposed NOMA-enabled multitask multiaccess computation offloading can outperform conventional orthogonal multiple access based offloading scheme, especially when the tasks have heavy computation-workload requirements and stringent delay limits. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	40
742	Trust-Enhanced Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Point of Interests Recommendation	Predicting the user's trajectory behavior sequence based on point of interests (POIs) recommendation is of great significance in the realization of the smart city with the emerging of social Internet of Things technology. One of the widely adopted frameworks is the user-based collaborative filtering, where the explicit POI rating is calculated based on similar users' preference. However, the trust between users is seldom considered. We believe that if two users show similar preferences or personality traits, the trust level between them should be high. To this end, we propose to calculate the trust-enhanced user similarity in user-based collaborative filtering based on network representation learning. Meanwhile, due to the significance of geographic influence and temporal influence, we integrate these two factors into POI recommendation by a fusion model. Therefore, our proposed POI recommendation system is unified collaborative recommendation framework, which fuses trust-enhanced users' preferences to potential POIs with geographic influences and temporal influence for POI recommendation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision@k and recall@k. Experimental results indicate that our proposed trust-enhanced collaborative filtering method outperforms other recommendation approaches. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	50
743	Lightweighted Secure Searching over Public-Key Ciphertexts for Edge-Cloud-Assisted Industrial IoT Devices	For the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) is a type of applicable and promising encryption technique to maintain the data stored in clouds secure and searchable. To further improve the efficiency of searching, it is popular to introduce edge computing near the IIoT as the substitute for a cloud. However, the straightforward collaboration of the two techniques performs negatively in latency-sensitive applications since the sluggish encryption of PEKS by IIoT devices negates the instant reaction of edges. To meet this challenge, in this article, we exploit the capability of the edge-cloud architecture and propose a lightweight-designed scheme called edge-aided searchable public-key encryption (ESPE). It allows IIoT devices to delegate their costly cryptographic operations to the nearby edge for fast computing and guarantees that all outsourced ciphertexts are semantically secure. Consequently, ESPE accelerates the corresponding ciphertext procedures on edges and saves over 70% encryption cost of an IIoT device. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
744	Rolling Bearing Fault Detection of Civil Aircraft Engine Based on Adaptive Estimation of Instantaneous Angular Speed	Diagnosis of a civil aircraft engine, which is operating under speed variation conditions, is a representative problem encountered in aeronautic industry. It is still very challenging to estimate the instantaneous angular speed (IAS) through the aircraft engine vibration signal when no encoder or tachometer is available due to cost or technological reasons. However, for the currently available tacholess order tracking algorithms, many vital parameters must be initialized manually in advance, which lead to user-friendliness, even false diagnosis. To address this issue, a novel method is proposed and the merits of nonlinear mode decomposition are inherited, so the IAS can be estimated adaptively without prior knowledge. The vibration signal collected from a civil aircraft engine is used for validation; the experimental results exhibit that the proposed method is more accurate and flexible when compared with the conventional methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	31

This article aims to develop an offloading strategy to decide the execution location, CPU frequency, and transmission power for UE while minimizing the execution overhead (i.e., a weighted sum of energy consumption and computational time) of UE's applications, which is an NP-hard problem. To achieve the objective, first, we transform the problem into a convex optimization problem and find the optimal solution. Second, we propose a decentralized computation offloading strategy (DCOS) algorithm for UE, and define a dictionary data structure for recording the strategy of the UE to reduce the algorithm complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of DCOS, and the impact of various key parameters on the strategy and overhead are demonstrated by simulation experiments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24

Extended from prescribed-time stability, practically prescribed-time stability (PPTS) is proposed for the first time aiming at stability analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear systems with disturbance and uncertainty. We show that, under the control scheme in the framework of PPTS, the system states are guaranteed to converge to a user-defined set (physically realizable) within user-defined settling time (physically realizable). Based on PPTS, an adaptive fault-tolerant controller is developed by integrating a novel exponential-type barrier Lyapunov function. Rigorous stability analysis based on back-stepping approach proves that, under the proposed control strategy, synchronization errors converge to a user-defined residual-set within predefined settling time and never exceed the prescribed range. Universal performance indexes, including the settling time, residual-set, accuracy, and overshoot, can be user-defined and only dependent on fewer user-defined parameters. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the developed control scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	61

Note that DoS attacks may block information transmission among BESSs by preventing the BESS from sending data, compromising the devices and jamming a communication network. A distributed secure control framework is presented, where an acknowledgment (ACK)-based attack detection strategy and a communication recovery mechanism are introduced to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks by repairing the paralyzed topology graphs caused by DoS attacks back into the initial connected graph. Under this framework, a distributed resilient finite-time secondary control scheme is proposed such that frequency regulation, active power sharing, and energy level balancing of BESSs can be achieved simultaneously in a finite time; meanwhile, operational constraints can be satisfied at any control transient time. Moreover, based on theoretical analysis, the impact of the duration time of DoS attacks on the convergence time of the control algorithm can be explicitly revealed. Finally, validity and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are demonstrated by case studies on a modified IEEE 57-bus testing system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	76

When dealing with high-dimensional signals mixed with much noise, however, the performance of a deep ESN is still highly affected by the random selection of input weights and reservoir weights, resulting in the optimal design of the deep ESN architecture, which is an open issue. For this reason, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm featuring a competitive swarm optimizer combined with a local search is proposed in this article. An indirect encoding method is designed based on the network characteristics of ESN to make the evolutionary process computationally economical. A layerwise optimization strategy is subsequently introduced for evolving deep ESNs. The results of two experimental cases show that the proposed approach has promising performance in identifying different faults reliably and accurately by comparing with other intelligent fault diagnosis approaches. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	99

752	On-Demand Transmission for Edge-Assisted Remote Control in Industrial Network Systems	Sensing data and control commands are frequently exchanged over communication networks for remote data acquisition and distributed control in industrial network control systems. The system performance relies on the design of sensing, transmission, and control. Due to the harsh environment in industrial field and the limited network resources, it is very challenging to meet the high requirement on transmission reliability for remote feedback control. In order to enhance the transmission ability for this kind of systems, an edge-assisted system architecture is proposed for the sensing and control processes. The parameter estimation for the sensing process is executed in the so-called edge estimator, and the controller is designed in a remote control center. Under this architecture, in this article an on-demand transmission scheme is designed by characterizing the overall effects of transmission reliability on the estimation and control performance. The overall system is optimized by formulating a revenue-cost maximization problem subject to the constraints of system stability, estimation convergence, spectrum utilization, and energy budget. The formulated mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem can be effectively solved with the block coordinate descent method. It is decomposed into two subproblems over disjoint variable sets. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages on both network-wide revenue and control-transmission cost. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
753	Resilient Model Predictive Control of Cyber-Physical Systems under DoS Attacks	This article presents a resilient model predictive control (MPC) framework to attenuate adverse effects of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), where the system dynamics is modeled by a linear time-invariant system. A DoS attacker targets at blocking the controller to actuator (C-A) communication channel by launching adversarial jamming signals. We show that, in order to guarantee exponential stability of the closed-loop system, several conditions for resilient MPC should be satisfied. And these established conditions are explicitly related to the duration of DoS attacks and MPC parameters such as the prediction horizon and the terminal constraint. Two key techniques, including the μ-step positively invariant set and the modified initial feasible set are exploited for achieving exponential stability in the presence of DoS attacks. Moreover, the maximum allowable duration of the DoS attacker is also obtained by using the μ-step positively invariant set. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed MPC algorithm is verified by simulated studies and comparisons. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	68
754	Resilient Consensus-Based Distributed Filtering: Convergence Analysis under Stealthy Attacks	In this article, we consider the security problem for the consensus-based distributed state estimation. To resist the malicious attacker who can falsify the data transmitted through the wireless channel, each node equips with an attack defender, which is based on the measurement of its built-in sensor. Under the stealthy attack, which can deceive the defender, we investigate the resilience and convergence of the distributed estimation in two different attack scenarios. For the attack with enough communication resources, we provide a sufficient condition of the optimal attack to quantify the maximum estimation performance degradation. We also analyze the resilience of the worst case distributed estimation caused by the attacker. For the attack with limited resources, the optimal Kalman gain for each node is derived to maximize its estimation performance under the attack. We also give a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of the distributed estimation in this case. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effect of the defender on guaranteeing the resilience of sensor networks against attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
755	Edge Coordinated Query Configuration for Low-Latency and Accurate Video Analytics	To develop smart city and intelligent manufacturing, video cameras are being increasingly deployed. In order to achieve fast and accurate response to live video queries (e.g., license plate recording and object tracking), the real-time high-volume video streams should be delivered and analyzed efficiently. In this article, we introduce an end-edge-cloud coordination framework for low-latency and accurate live video analytics. Considering the locality of video queries, edge platform is designated as the system coordinator. It accepts live video queries and configures the related end cameras to generate video frames that meet quality requirements. By taking into account the latency constraint, edge computing resources are subtly distributed to process the live video frames from different sources such that the analytic accuracy of the accepted video queries can be maximized. Since the amount of required edge computing resource and video quality to accurately address different video queries are unknown in advance, we propose an online video quality and computing resource configuration algorithm to gradually learn the optimal configuration strategy. Extensive simulation results show that as compared to other benchmarks, the proposed configuration algorithm can effectively improve the analytic accuracy, while providing low-latency response. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	32
756	PTASIM: Incentivizing Crowdsensing with POI-Tagging Cooperation over Edge Clouds	In this article, we propose points-of-interest (POI)-tagging App-assisted incentive mechanism (PTASIM), an incentive mechanism that explores the cooperation with POI-tagging App for mobile edge crowdsensing (MEC). PTASIM requests App to tag some edges to be POI, which further guides App users to perform tasks at that location. We further model the interactions of users, platform, and App by a three-stage decision process. App first determines the POI-tagging price to maximize its payoff. Platform and users subsequently decide how to determine tasks reward and select edges to be tagged, and how to select the best task to perform, respectively. We analyze the optimal solution in those stages. Specifically, we prove that greedy algorithm could provide the optimal solution for platform's payoff maximization in polynomial time. The numerical results show that: 1) the cooperation with App brings long-term and sufficient participation; and 2) the optimal strategies reduce platform's tasks cost as well as improve App's revenues. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
757	A Truthful Online Mechanism for Collaborative Computation Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing	Collaborative computation offloading in mobile edge computing where edge users offload tasks opportunistically to resourceful neighboring mobile devices (MDs), offers a promising solution to satisfy low-latency requirements. However, most existing works assume that those MDs volunteer to help edge users without an incentive mechanism. In this article, we propose an auction-based incentive mechanism, where users and MDs participate in the system dynamically. Our auction mechanism runs in the online fashion and optimizes the long-term system welfare without knowledge of future information, e.g., task start time, task length, resource demand, and valuation, etc. We prove that the proposed online mechanism achieves the desired properties, including individual rationality, truthfulness, and computational tractability. Moreover, the theoretical competitive ratio shows that our online mechanism achieves near-optimal long-term social welfare close to the offline optimum. Extensive experiments based on real-world traces demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed online mechanism. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	27
758	Blockchain-Based Mobile Crowd Sensing in Industrial Systems	The smart factory is a representative element reshaping conventional computer-aided industry to data-driven smart industry, while it is nontrivial to achieve cost effectiveness, reliability, mobility, and scalability of smart industrial systems. Data-driven industrial systems mainly rely on sensory data collected from statically deployed sensors. However, the spatial coverage of industrial sensor networks is constrained due to the high deployment and maintenance cost. Recently, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has become a new sensing paradigm owing to its merits, such as cost effectiveness, mobility, and scalability. Nevertheless, traditional MCS systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks and single point of failure due to the centralized architecture. To this end, in this article we integrate MCS with industrial systems without introducing any additional dedicated devices. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional MCS systems, we propose a blockchain-based MCS system (BMCS). In particular, we exploit miners to verify the sensory data and design a dynamic reward ranking incentive mechanism to mitigate the imbalance of multiple sensing tasks. Meanwhile, we also develop a sensory data quality detection scheme to identify and mitigate the data anomaly. We implement a prototype of the BMCS on top of Ethereum and conduct extensive experiments on a realistic factory workroom. Both experimental results and security analysis demonstrate that the BMCS can secure industrial systems and improve the system reliability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	45
759	A Trust-Based Team Formation Framework for Mobile Intelligence in Smart Factories	In Smart Factories, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) accomplish heterogeneous tasks as moving objects, restoring connectivity, or performing different manufacturing activities into production lines. These kinds of devices combine several capabilities, as artificial intelligence (visual and speech recognition, automatic fault detecting, proactive behavior) and mobility, into the so-called 'mobile intelligence.' A typical scenario is represented by a workshop with a large number of mobile intelligent devices with associated agents, mutually interacting on their behalf. Here, to reach a given target by contemporary satisfying some basic requirements like effectiveness and efficiency, it is often necessary to organize ad hoc teams of free-moving vehicles, sensors, and smart devices. Therefore, a specific issue is the adequate representation of the reciprocal agent/device trustworthiness for advantaging such team formation processes within a smart factory environment. To this end, in this article, first, we define a trust measure based on reliability and reputation of AGVs, which are computed based on the feedbacks released for the AGVs activities in the factory; second, we design a trust framework exploiting the defined measures to support the formation of virtual, temporary, and trust-based teams of mobile intelligent devices; and third, we present a set of experimental results highlighting that the proposed trust framework can improve the workshop performance in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	39
760	Manipulation with Domino Effect for Cache- And Buffer-Enabled Social IIoT: Preserving Stability in Tripartite Graphs	As a new Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm where smart devices work socially by exploiting social ties with adjacent devices, the Social IoT can effectively meet the real-time data sharing demands in Industrial IoT scenario, with the inter-device social relations being incentives. Besides, precaching on device level can potentially combat the backhaul capacity bottlenecks. Considering the limited cache memory, we may not use the whole capacity for caching, but leave a fraction for buffering data packets. In this article, we investigate how to maximize the quality of experience while minimizing the energy consumption. First, we design a proactive cache placement scheme for cost minimization. Next, we conceive the content sharing procedure with the framework of tripartite graph and propose a ternary stable matching algorithm to let devices self-organize the content sharing. Finally, we prove that inconspicuous manipulation with domino effect can further improve the system performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
761	Joint Computation and Communication Design for UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing in IoT	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) system is a prominent concept, where a UAV equipped with an MEC server is deployed to serve a number of terminal devices (TDs) of Internet of Things in a finite period. In this article, each TD has a certain latency-critical computation task in each time slot to complete. Three computation strategies can be available to each TD. First, each TD can operate local computing by itself. Second, each TD can partially offload task bits to the UAV for computing. Third, each TD can choose to offload task bits to access point via UAV relaying. We propose a new optimization problem formulation that aims to minimize the total energy consumption including communication-related energy, computation-related energy and UAV's flight energy by optimizing the bits allocation, time slot scheduling, and power allocation as well as UAV trajectory design. As the formulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to find the optimal solution, we propose to solve the problem by two parts, and obtain the near optimal solution by the Lagrangian duality method and successive convex approximation technique, respectively. By analysis, the proposed algorithm can be guaranteed to converge within a dozen of iterations. Finally, numerical results are given to validate the proposed algorithm, which is verified to be efficient and superior to the other benchmark cases. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	140
762	Advances and Emerging Challenges in Cognitive Internet-of-Things	The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their adoption in new generation intelligent systems has generated a huge demand for wireless bandwidth. This bandwidth problem is further exacerbated by another characteristics of IoT applications, i.e., IoT devices are usually deployed in massive number, thus leading to an awkward scenario that many bandwidth-hungry devices are chasing after the very limited wireless bandwidth within a small geographic area. As such, cognitive radio has received much attention of the research community as an important means for addressing the bandwidth needs of IoT applications. When enabling IoT devices with cognitive functionalities including spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum accessing, circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning, one will also need to fully study other critical issues such as standardization, privacy protection, and heterogeneous coexistence. In this article, we investigate the structural frameworks and potential applications of cognitive IoT. We further discuss the spectrum-based functionalities and heterogeneity for cognitive IoT. Security and privacy issues involved in cognitive IoT are also investigated. Finally, we present the key challenges and future direction of research on cognitive-radio-based IoT networks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	27
763	PSDRNN: An Efficient and Effective HAR Scheme Based on Feature Extraction and Deep Learning	Recently, in this article, due to pervasive usability, smartphone-based human activity recognition (HAR) has witnessed significant development in smart health. Meanwhile, deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) shows a strong ability to automatically extract features from the time-series data, and therefore, DRNN-based HAR schemes have achieved more effective recognition (i.e., recognition accuracy) than those adopting the traditional machine learning. However, the efficiency in training and recognition (in terms of running time) has not fully taken into account, especially for resource-constraint smartphones. To solve the above issue, we propose the PSDRNN and tri-PSDRNN schemes that employ the explicit feature extraction before DRNN. Specifically, considering that the power spectral density (PSD) feature can capture the frequency characteristics and meanwhile retain the successive time characteristics of data gathered from smartphone accelerometer, PSD feature vectors are, respectively, extracted from linear accelerations and triaxle accelerations and explicitly used as the input to the following DRNN classification model. Thorough experiments based on a real dataset demonstrate that the PSDRNN can achieve the comparable effectiveness as the xyz-DRNN (the most accurate DRNN-based HAR scheme only using acceleration data), and the average recognition and training time were reduced by 56% and 80%, respectively. Moreover, tri-PSDRNN advantages over the xyz-DRNN in terms of recognition accuracy, and the running time is still lower than the xyz-DRNN. Besides, our proposed PSDRNN scheme achieved superiority in the recognition of complex transition activities. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
764	A Framework of Priority-Aware Packet Transmission Scheduling in Cluster-Based Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks	Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are the fundamental components in the next-generation factories. Due to massive heterogeneous data generated from large-scale IWSNs, it is still challenging to achieve predictable, deterministic, and real-time transmission scheduling. In this article, a framework of priority-aware packet transmission scheduling (PPTS) in cluster-based IWSNs is proposed, where the PPTS strategy, the optimization theory, and the implementation design are systematically considered. In particular, the proposed PPTS strategy not only minimizes the transmission delay of high priority packets but also greatly improves the transmission delay of low priority packets. The optimization theory for end-to-end priority-aware scheduling in cluster-based IWSNs is formalized, which contributes to the optimal solution for multidimensional network resources allocation and achieves the minimum of average transmission delay. Finally, the advantages of the PPTS framework over some existing solutions are demonstrated by a case study. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22
765	Social-Aware Incentive Mechanisms for D2D Resource Sharing in IIoT	The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), as one of the indispensable paradigms of the future network, challenges existing computing network architectures by supporting computational-intensive applications. In the IIoT, resource-rich industrial devices may share idle computing resource to lightweight nodes through device-to-device (D2D) technology, whereas such resource sharing is under social and locality constraints. When industrial devices are carried by human or installed on manned machines, resource sharing more likely occurs among social-trustworthy and locality-adjacent devices. In this article, we propose two social-aware incentive mechanisms for D2D resource sharing in the IIoT, namely one-hop-based social-aware incentive mechanism (OSIM) and relay-based social-aware incentive mechanism (RSIM). In the OSIM, resource-constrained devices bid for offloading tasks using a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction, while the RSIM relaxes the locality constraint to two hops to achieve a higher resource utilization ratio. Extensive simulation results show that the performance of the proposed mechanisms can significantly improve the system efficiency while maintaining truthfulness. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	34
766	Deep Reinforcement Learning for Social-Aware Edge Computing and Caching in Urban Informatics	Empowered with urban informatics, transportation industry has witnessed a paradigm shift. These developments lead to the need of content processing and sharing between vehicles under strict delay constraints. Mobile edge services can help meet these demands through computation offloading and edge caching empowered transmission, while cache-enabled smart vehicles may also work as carriers for content dispatch. However, diverse capacities of edge servers and smart vehicles, as well as unpredictable vehicle routes, make efficient content distribution a challenge. To cope with this challenge, in this article we develop a social-aware nobile edge computing and caching mechanism by exploiting the relation between vehicles and roadside units. By leveraging a deep reinforcement learning approach, we propose optimal content processing and caching schemes that maximize the dispatch utility in an urban environment with diverse vehicular social characteristics. Numerical results based on real urban traffic datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22
767	Design of Binary Erasure Code with Triple Simultaneous Objectives for Distributed Edge Caching in Industrial Internet of Things Networks	For one moving Internet of Things (IoT) collector to download files from nearby industrial IoT devices, storing network coded files into multiple IoT devices can achieve good reliability performance if the following (n, k) erasure property (EP) is fulfilled: k source packets are encoded into n packets, and k packets chosen from these n packets in an arbitrary manner can reconstruct all the source packets. Besides, low decoding complexity is desired for time-sensitive applications and energy-limited moving IoT collectors, and binary zigzag decoding (BZD) achieves significantly low decoding complexity. The objective of previous EP-BZD designs is unilateral, which limits its application scenarios. In this article, a novel EP-BZD code is designed, which achieves good tradeoff among largest storage room overhead (SRO), SRO variance, and wide range of (n, k). To implement such a code, the source packets are shifted by several bits, respectively, and then Xored together. The numbers of bits shifted are represented by a matrix, which is obtained from a specially constructed triangle by taking a certain maximal submatrix. The triangle is obtained by a series of steps, including the construction of base vector, parallelogram, trapezoid, etc. The proof that the proposed code possesses EP and BZD simultaneously is also provided. A series of comparisons verify that the proposed code achieves significantly better tradeoff among triple objectives than existing EP-BZD codes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
768	Latency and Lifetime Enhancements in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks: A Q-Learning Approach for Graph Routing	Industrial wireless sensor networks usually have a centralized management approach, where a device known as network manager is responsible for the overall configuration, definition of routes, and allocation of communication resources. Graph routing is used to increase the reliability of communication through path redundancy. Some of the state-of-the-art graph-routing algorithms use weighted cost equations to define preferences on how the routes are constructed. The characteristics and requirements of these networks complicate to find a proper set of weight values to enhance network performance. Reinforcement learning can be useful to adjust these weights according to the current operating conditions of the network. In this article, we present the Q-learning reliable routing with a weighting agent approach, where an agent adjusts the weights of a state-of-the-art graph-routing algorithm. The states of the agent represent sets of weights, and the actions change the weights during network operation. Rewards are given to the agent when the average network latency decreases or the expected network lifetime increases. Simulations were conducted on a WirelessHART simulator considering industrial monitoring applications with random topologies. Results show, in most cases, a reduction of the average network latency while the expected network lifetime and the communication reliability are at least as good as what is obtained by the state-of-the-art graph-routing algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23
769	A Novel Framework of Three-Hierarchical Offloading Optimization for MEC in Industrial IoT Networks	In this article, we investigate a communication and computation problem for industrial Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where K relays can help accomplish the computation tasks with the assist of M computational access points. In industrial IoT networks, latency and energy consumption are two important metrics of interest to measure the system performance. To enhance the system performance, a three-hierarchical optimization framework is proposed to reduce the latency and energy consumption, which involves bandwidth allocation, offloading, and relay selection. Specifically, we first optimize the bandwidth allocation by presenting three schemes for the second-hop wireless relaying. We then optimize the computation offloading based on the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm. We further present three relay selection criteria by taking into account the tradeoff between the system performance and implementation complexity. Simulation results are finally demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed three-hierarchical optimization framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	59
770	A Dynamic Multipath Scheme for Protecting Source-Location Privacy Using Multiple Sinks in WSNs Intended for IIoT	Among several new technologies, such as social and cognitive mobile computing, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) constitute the founding pillar of the industrial Internet of Things. These networks are expected to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives. Social and cognitive mobile computing requires the sharing of data recorded by sensor nodes. However, the data can be vulnerable to attacks. It is of utmost importance to protect the users privacy while ensuring the security of the WSNs. This investigation is focused on the source-location privacy (SLP) of WSNs. This article proposes a dynamic multipath privacy-preserving routing (DMPPR) scheme based on multiple sinks for protecting the privacy. Different from single sink schemes, the technique of using multiple sink nodes to protect SLP is discussed in this article. Furthermore, a packet-slicing transmission scheme that generates a large number of dynamic routings based on multiple sink nodes is adopted for transmitting the packets. Local adversaries are considered, and to cope with these adversaries, a transmission loop, constructed using real and fake packets, is proposed to confuse the adversaries during the source detection process. The aim is to break the sociality between the sensor nodes. Simulations performed in MATLAB show that the proposed method outperforms similar existing schemes in terms of the secure time, adversary's capture probability, and node utilization ratio. Moreover, the DMPPR scheme also reduces energy consumption by allowing more nodes in the nonhotspot areas to participate in the packet transmission process. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	38
771	LoRaWAN Range Extender for Industrial IoT	The LoRaWAN technology, an example of low power wide area network, is considered a possible IoT-derived solution for realizing private cellular (single-hop) communications in the industrial domain. However, despite LoRaWAN promises long range and dense environments with many obstacles (as the industrial ones), it may suffer from coverage issue. Additionally, the inverse relationship between data rates and range may be unacceptable for many industrial applications. In this article, an innovative LoRaWAN range extender (based on an enhanced LoRaWAN node) is described, and its integration in the infrastructure of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-enabled industrial wireless networks is presented. A frame relay strategy is suggested, thus avoiding to tradeoff the highest data rates against an increased sensitivity. The feasibility of the solution is formally verified and the features of the realized proof-of-concept prototype, based on commercially available hardware, are discussed. The experimental results, obtained with a purposely designed test bench, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, the range extender is transparent for legacy LoRaWAN networks as confirmed by correct relaying of uplink and downlink for different types of LoRaWAN message. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42

Among the several LPWAN technologies, LoRaWAN has been extensively addressed by the research community and the industry. However, the reliability and scalability of LoRaWAN are still uncertain. One of the techniques to increase the reliability of LoRaWAN is message replication, which exploits time diversity. This article proposes a novel hybrid coded message replication scheme that interleaves simple repetition and a recently proposed coded replication method. We analyze the optimization of the proposed scheme under minimum reliability requirements and show that it enhances the network performance without requiring additional transmit power compared to the competing replication techniques. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
773	Cooperative-Evolution-Based WPT Resource Allocation for Large-Scale Cognitive Industrial IoT	The recently developed technique of wireless power transfer (WPT) provides a promising way to charge the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) of cognitive industrial Internet of Things (IoT) deployed in areas that are difficult for humans to access. Previous work has focused on the power allocation strategy at the wireless node level. However, the priority among different modes in an identical wireless node has not been taken into consideration, and different modes equipped with different types of batteries accomplish different tasks in an identical wireless node. One challenging scenario is rechargeable WSNs with a large number of wireless nodes. In this article, we aim to optimize the power allocation strategy in priority constraint WPT systems with a large number of wireless nodes. Traditional WPT systems consist of a rechargeable WSN and a mobile charger, which are deployed for charging wireless nodes in a wireless manner. However, the constructed WPT system consists of a rechargeable WSN and multiple mobile chargers with adequate power, which can charge wireless nodes simultaneously. Each solution of the power allocation strategy can be represented as one disjunctive graph, and the critical path (CP) in the disjunctive graph is the core factor in determining the final maximum cost. Thus, we propose a decomposition strategy that can identify the interacting variables based on the CP by exploiting the perturbation technique. Then, the decomposed subcomponents are cooperatively evolved by adopting a cooperative evolutionary algorithm (CEA). The proposed CP-based grouping strategy combined with CEA is named CPCEA. Three state-of-The-Art methods are tested and compared with CPCEA, and three scales of datasets are considered. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of CPCEA. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26

Nevertheless, with increasing demands for computation service, how to design reliable transmission mechanism and allocate proper computation resource has become bottlenecks. In this article, we propose a computation offloading mechanism based on two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze the interaction between multiple edge clouds and multiple IIoT devices. To be specific, the edge clouds are denoted as leaders who set the appropriate price for their computation resource. Besides considering the payment cost, the IIoT devices which are termed as the followers formulate their utility function by considering the social interaction information from the potential IIoT devices. The existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium are analyzed considering two possible cases, i.e., complete information and incomplete information. Moreover, two dynamic iterative algorithms are invoked for solving both problem models, respectively. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed scheme is conducive to seeking the appropriate price and computation requirement. Besides, social interaction information plays an important role in achieving a reasonable computation requirement for IIoT devices. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	29
775	Energy Minimization in D2D-Assisted Cache-Enabled Internet of Things: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach	Mobile edge caching (MEC) and device-to-device (D2D) communications are two potential technologies to resolve traffic overload problems in the Internet of Things. Previous works usually investigate them separately with MEC for traffic offloading and D2D for information transmission. In this article, a joint framework consisting of MEC and cache-enabled D2D communications is proposed to minimize the energy cost of systematic traffic transmission, where file popularity and user preference are the critical criteria for small base stations (SBSs) and user devices, respectively. Under this framework, we propose a novel caching strategy, where the Markov decision process is applied to model the requesting behaviors. A novel scheme based on reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to reveal the popularity of files as well as users' preference. In particular, a Q-learning algorithm and a deep Q-network algorithm are, respectively, applied to user devices and the SBS due to different complexities of status. To save the energy cost of systematic traffic transmission, users acquire partial traffic through D2D communications based on the cached contents and user distribution. Taking the memory limits, D2D available files, and status changing into consideration, the proposed RL algorithm enables user devices and the SBS to prefetch the optimal files while learning, which can reduce the energy cost significantly. Simulation results demonstrate the superior energy saving performance of the proposed RL-based algorithm over other existing methods under various conditions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26

777	Multivehicle Coordinated Lane Change Strategy in the Roundabout under Internet of Vehicles Based on Game Theory and Cognitive Computing	The roundabouts exist widely in urban road networks and reduce the number of traffic crashes by reducing vehicle conflicts. However, road restrictions at the entrances and exits increase the collision possibility between vehicles as they enter or leave the roundabouts. Focusing on the driving scenes in a roundabout, this article proposes a multivehicle coordinated lane change strategy for the mandatory lane change of vehicles. First, depending on the fluctuation of the vehicle acceleration, the driver's aggressive coefficient is defined. Second, according to the vehicle's driving state and its distance to the exit, a cost function is proposed and model predictive control is used to control the vehicle's motion. Moreover, the Stackelberg game is utilized to model the relationship between the lane change vehicle and its surrounding vehicles, and then to determine the timing of the changing lane. Finally, the simulation experiments verify whether the algorithm can improve the average speed of the vehicle and maintain the driving stability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
778	Energy-Neutral and QoS-Aware Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks for Health Monitoring of Hoisting Systems	Hoisting equipment is core to many industrial systems and, therefore, their state of health significantly affects production lines and personnel safety; this is especially important in environments such as coal mines. The health of the hoisting system can be estimated by deploying energy harvesting wireless sensor nodes that monitor the drum surface stress. In this network of sensor devices, it is very costly to send highly sampled data as it causes radio congestion and consumes energy. However, from our experience of sensing hoist systems, we note that the data observed at the upper surface of the hoist are significantly more indicative of the state of health of the whole system, compared with data sensed at the lower surface. Therefore, we need to take advantage of this to optimize the communications of sensor nodes. However, scarce energy can be collected for these devices from the hoist itself, along with the prioritized Quality of Service (QoS) requirements (throughput, delay) of monitoring signals, raises important challenges for energy management. In this article, we use Lyapunov optimization techniques and propose an energy-neutral and QoS-Aware protocol (EQP), including duty cycling and network scheduling to solve it. Extensive simulations show that the EQP helps sensor nodes realize consecutive monitoring, and achieve more than 38% utility gain compared with existing strategies. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
779	Learning-Based Energy-Efficient Resource Management by Heterogeneous RF/VLC for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Industrial IoT Networks	Smart factory under Industry 4.0 and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. In wireless industrial networks, industrial IoT and IoT devices have different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, ranging from ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) to high transmission data rates. These industrial networks will be highly complex and heterogeneous, as well as the spectrum and energy resources are severely limited. Hence, this article presents a heterogeneous radio frequency (RF)/visible light communication (VLC) industrial network architecture to guarantee the different QoS requirements, where RF is capable of offering wide-area coverage and VLC has the ability to provide high transmission data rate. A joint uplink and downlink energy-efficient resource management decision-making problem (network selection, subchannel assignment, and power management) is formulated as a Markov decision process. In addition, a new deep post-decision state (PDS)-based experience replay and transfer (PDS-ERT) reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to learn the optimal policy. Simulation results corroborate the superiority in performance of the presented heterogeneous network, and verify that the proposed PDS-ERT learning algorithm outperforms other existing algorithms in terms of meeting the energy efficiency and the QoS requirements. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	76
780	Optical Scanning Tilt Holography	Digital holography (DH) can record optical field of a three-dimensional (3-D) object, and the 3-D information can be retrieved and processed digitally. Thus, DH has application potential in 3-D sensing and metrology. However, it is hard for conventional DH to record the off-axis object light because of the limitation of the arrayed sensor. In this paper, optical scanning holography (OSH) is proposed to record the off-axis object light. OSH is a scanning-type and single-pixel holographic technique for 3-D imaging. Therefore, OSH can directly record the off-axis object light by using a small sampling pitch. This is, however, a waste of both bandwidth and recording time. For this reason, a new scheme called optical scanning tilt holography (OSTH) is proposed in this paper. In OSTH, the scanning beam is tilted related to the object axis, and thus the off-axis object light can be recorded by using a large sampling pitch. Although the horizontal resolution of OSTH is worse than that of OSH in normal scanning, the axial resolution of OSTH is better than that of OSH. In addition, the reconstruction plane of OSTH is always parallel to that of OSH in normal scanning. Therefore, there is no need of coordinate transformation post to the holographic recording. These features enable OSTH to be applied in depth sensing and stereoscopic imaging. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
781	Distributed Blockchain-Based Trusted Multidomain Collaboration for Mobile Edge Computing in 5G and beyond	Mobile edge computing (MEC) sinks computing power to the edge of networks and integrates mobile access networks and Internet services in 5G and beyond. With the continuous development of services, privacy protection is extremely important in a heterogeneous MEC system for multiserver collaboration. However, most of the existing schemes only consider the privacy of users or services other than the privacy of network topology. For the purpose of topology privacy protection, this article employs blockchain to construct heterogeneous MEC systems and adopts accommodative bloom filter as a carrier for multidomain collaborative routing consensus without exposing topology privacy. Blockchain is used to implement multiplex mutual trust networking and collaborative routing verification through the membership service and consensus mechanism. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performances of our scheme. The results indicate that the proposed scheme can highly improve the credibility and efficiency of MEC collaboration. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	93
782	Dynamical Resource Allocation in Edge for Trustable Internet-of-Things Systems: A Reinforcement Learning Method	Edge computing (EC) is now emerging as a key paradigm to handle the increasing Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices connected to the edge of the network. By using the services deployed on the service provisioning system which is made up of edge servers nearby, these IoT devices are enabled to fulfill complex tasks effectively. Nevertheless, it also brings challenges in trustworthiness management. The volatile environment will make it difficult to comply with the service-level agreement (SLA), which is an important index of trustworthiness declared by these IoT services. In this article, by denoting the trustworthiness gain with how well the SLA can comply, we first encode the state of the service provisioning system and the resource allocation scheme and model the adjustment of allocated resources for services as a Markov decision process (MDP). Based on these, we get a trained resource allocating policy with the help of the reinforcement learning (RL) method. The trained policy can always maximize the services' trustworthiness gain by generating appropriate resource allocation schemes dynamically according to the system states.

783	Signal Estimation in Underlay Cognitive Networks for Industrial Internet of Things	Underlay cognitive radio (CR) holds the promise to address spectrum scarcity and let industrial wireless sensor networks obtain spectrum extension from shared frequency band resources. However, underlay CR devices should be capable of properly adjusting wireless transmission parameters according to the sensing of wireless environments. To realize the goal, in this article, two different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation methods are proposed for time-frequency overlapped signal estimations in the underlay CR-based industrial Internet of Things (IoT). In the first method, normalized higher order cumulant equations and the theoretical value of normalized higher order cumulants are adopted to estimate the SNR of component signals and the SNR of received signals. In the second one, the power of each component signals and the received signals is estimated based on the second-order time-varying moments. For the performance analysis, the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the SNR estimation for the time-frequency overlapped signals is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed method based on normalized higher order cumulants not only can effectively estimate the SNR of the time-frequency overlapped signals, but also has the strong robustness to the spectrum overlapped rate and the hybrid power ratio. The proposed method with second-order time-varying moments is able to accurately estimate the SNR of the time-frequency overlapped signals effectively, especially in the low-SNR region. These features are extremely useful in the industrial IoT, which usually operate in low-SNR regimes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
784	NOMA-Based Resource Allocation for Cluster-Based Cognitive Industrial Internet of Things	The development of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been limited due to the shortage of spectrum resources. Based on cognitive radio, the cognitive IIoT (CIIoT) has been proposed to improve spectrum utilization via sensing and accessing the idle spectrum. To improve sensing and transmission performance of the CIIoT, a cluster-based CIIoT is proposed, in this article, wherein the cluster heads perform cooperative spectrum sensing to get available spectrum, and the nodes transmit via nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The frame structure of the CIIoT is designed, and the spectrum access probability and average total throughput of the CIIoT are deduced. A joint resource optimization for sensing time, node powers, and the number of clusters is formulated to maximize the average total throughput. The optimal solution is obtained via sensing and power optimization. The clustering algorithm and cluster head alternation are proposed to improve transmission performance and ensure energy balance, respectively. The simulations have indicated that the NOMA for the cluster-based CIIoT can better guarantee the transmission performance of each node, especially the node decoded first, than the traditional NOMA and orthogonal multiple access. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	194
785	Spatially Coupled Codes via Partial and Recursive Superposition for Industrial IoT with High Trustworthiness	For industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), data trustworthiness should be maintained both at the time of sensing and at the time of transmission. This article is concerned with trustworthiness during transmission, which is determined by transmission reliability. We present a low-complexity and flexible method via partial and recursive superposition to improve the transmission reliability of IIoT, resulting in an IIoT with high trustworthiness. In our method, a portion of the previously transmitted data are superimposed onto the current transmitted data to introduce memory among different transmissions, which are then exploited by the windowed decoder to obtain performance gain. The proposed method is referred to as partially recursive block Markov superposition transmission of low-density parity-check (PrBMST-LDPC) codes. This article is focused on the construction of low-complexity PrBMST-LDPC codes since IIoT is resource-limited in nature. The first construction is the memory-one PrBMST-LDPC code. We present a simplified density evolution algorithm to optimize the superposition ratio for memory-one PrBMST-LDPC code. Both the analytical and numerical results show that PrBMST with memory one can be used to reduce the packet loss ratio (PLR) of IIoT using LDPC codes. Particularly, around 1.0 dB performance gain is obtained by PrBMST. We then present a low-complexity construction for PrBMST-LDPC codes with encoding memory larger than one. Simulation results show that compared with memory-one PrBMST, a further PLR reduction of around one order of magnitude can be obtained. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
786	Reinforcement Learning-Based Multislot Double-Threshold Spectrum Sensing with Bayesian Fusion for Industrial Big Spectrum Data	With the rapid increase of industrial systems, industrial spectrum is stepping into the era of big data, and at the same time spectrum resources are facing serious shortage. Cognitive industrial system (CIS) based on cognitive radio can improve spectrum utilization by accessing the idle spectrum licensed to primary user. However, the CIS must find enough idle channels by performing spectrum sensing. In this article, a reinforcement learning-based multislot double-threshold spectrum sensing with Bayesian fusion is proposed to sense industrial big spectrum data, which can find required idle channels faster while guaranteeing spectrum sensing performance. Double thresholds are set to guarantee both high detection probability and spectrum access probability, and weighed energy detection is proposed to maximize detection probability when the energy statistic falls into the confusion area between the double thresholds. Bayesian fusion is proposed to get a final decision on the channel availability by combining the local sensing decisions of all the time slots. A prediction and selection algorithm for idle channels is proposed to predict the idle probability of each channel and find required idle channels from the sorted channel set. From simulation results, the proposed spectrum sensing scheme outperforms cooperative spectrum sensing and energy detection, which can predict idle channels accurately and get needed idle channels with fewer sensing operations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	32
787	Trustworthy Network Anomaly Detection Based on an Adaptive Learning Rate and Momentum in IIoT	While the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) brings convenience to the industry, it also brings security problems. Due to the massive amount of data generated by the surge of IIoT devices, it is impossible to ensure whether these data contain an attack or untrustworthy data, therefore, how to ensure the security and trustworthiness of IIoT devices has become an urgent problem to solve. In this article, we design a new hinge classification algorithm based on mini-batch gradient descent with an adaptive learning rate and momentum (HCA-MBGDALRM) to minimize the effects of security attacks. The algorithm significantly improves the performance of deep network training compared with traditional neural networks, decision trees and logistic regression in terms of scale and speed. In addition, we have solved the data skew problem in the shuffle phase, and we implement a parallel framework for HCA-MBGDALRM to accelerate the processing speed of very large traffic data sets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	53
788	Increasing the Trustworthiness in the Industrial IoT Networks through a Reliable Cyberattack Detection Model	The trustworthiness of an industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network is an important stakeholder expectation. Maintaining the trustworthiness of such a network is crucial to void the loss of lives. A trustworthy IIoT system combines the security characteristics of IT trustworthiness-safety, security, privacy, reliability, and resilience. Conventional security tools and techniques are not enough to safeguard the IIoT platform due to the difference in protocols, limited upgrade opportunities, mismatch in protocols, and older versions of the operating system used in the industrial system. In this article, we propose to improve the trustworthiness of an IIoT network [i.e., supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network] through a reliable and salable cyberattack detection model. In particular, an ensemble-learning model based on the combination of a random subspace (RS) learning method with random tree (RT) is proposed for detecting cyberattacks of SCADA by using the network traffics from the SCADA-based IIoT platform. The novelty of the proposed model is that it uses the industrial protocol-based network traffic and the RS to solve the sensitivity of irrelevant features and ensemble RT to reduce the overfitting problem, thereby constructs a detection engine based on industrial protocols and achieves high detection rates. The proposed model has been tested over 15 datasets of the SCADA network. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model outperforms conventional detection techniques and, thus, improves the security and related measure of the trustworthiness of the IIoT platform. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	48
789	An Integrated Histogram-Based Vision and Machine-Learning Classification Model for Industrial Emulsion Processing	Existing techniques in emulsion quality evaluation are found to be highly subjective, time-consuming, and prone to overprocessing. Other conventional droplet analysis techniques such as laser diffraction, which require dilution of samples, introduce an additional complexity to industrial processes. The possibility of developing a fully automated technique for droplet characterization during emulsification holds remarkable potential for overcoming the existing challenges. In this article, a histogram-based image segmentation technique detects droplets from emulsion micrographs. The evolution of droplet characteristics and their significance are studied by performing statistical analysis, and the significant characteristics are selected. The principal component analysis is applied to obtain a reduced set of uncorrelated components from the selected characteristics. The linear discriminant analysis classifies the micrographs into a set of quality categories called target, acceptable, marginal, and unacceptable. The model accuracy is validated using stratified five-fold cross-validation and is successful in classifying the micrographs obtained from two different manufacturing facilities with high accuracy up to 100%. The histogram-based technique is successful in detecting smaller droplets than previously reflected in the literature. The current approach is fully automated and is implemented as a soft-sensor, which supports its real-time deployment into an industrial environment. The entire approach has promising potential in the in-line prediction of emulsion quality leading to more efficient and sustainable manufacturing. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
790	Model Compression for IoT Applications in Industry 4.0 via Multiscale Knowledge Transfer	Recently, Industry 4.0 has attracted much attention. It has close relations with the Internet of Things (IoT). On the other hand, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising performance in many foundational services of the IoT applications. For the IoT applications with high-speed data streams and the requirement of time-sensitive actions, fast processing is demanded on small-scale platforms or even on IoT devices themselves. Therefore, it is inappropriate to employ cumbersome CNNs in IoT applications, making the study of model compression necessary. In knowledge transfer, it is common to employ a deep, well-trained network, called teacher, to guide a shallow, untrained network, called student, to have better performance. Previous works have made many attempts to transfer single-scale knowledge from teacher to student, leading to degradation of generalization ability. In this article, we introduce multiscale representations to knowledge transfer, which facilitates the generalization ability of student. We divide student and teacher into several stages. Student learns from multiscale knowledge provided by teacher at the end of each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method both on image classification and on single image super-resolution. The huge performance gap between student and teacher is significantly narrowed down by our proposed method, making student suitable for IoT applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14

Unfortunately, a more practical diagnostic scenario, i.e., unsupervised partial transfer diagnosis, has not yet been well addressed. In view of this, a novel unsupervised intelligent diagnosis framework named classifier inconsistency-based domain adaptation network is proposed in this article. In this approach, two discriminative one-dimensional convolutional networks are designed as the basic architecture. The source samples of the same categories as the target domain are then identified and emphasized to boost positive network training. Meanwhile, the classifier inconsistency is introduced to guide the model to learn discriminative and domain-invariant representations for the correct classification of unlabeled target data. Extensive experiments on two datasets are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. Additionally, five popular methods are selected for comparison. The comprehensive results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	38
792	Cross-Network Fusion and Scheduling for Heterogeneous Networks in Smart Factory	In the context of Industry 4.0, extensive deployment and application of advanced manufacturing equipment and various sensors is leading to a growing demand for data exchange between different devices. In smart factories, network transmission has multiprotocol features of wired/wireless communication, and different data flows have different real-time requirements. In this article, a heterogeneous network architecture based on software-defined network is proposed for realizing cross-network flexible forwarding of multisource manufacturing data and optimized utilization of network resources. Subsequently, the mechanism of cross-network fusion and scheduling (CNFS) is analyzed from the perspective of high dynamic characteristics and different delay requirements of data flows. Based on this analysis, a route-aware data flow dynamic reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm improves the efficiency of manufacturing data cross-network fusion, especially for multivariety and small-batch intelligent manufacturing systems. Furthermore, for meeting the bandwidth requirements of different delay flows, a delay-sensitive network bandwidth scheduling algorithm is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CNFS mechanism is verified using a candy packaging intelligent production line prototype platform. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
793	Latency-Driven Parallel Task Data Offloading in Fog Computing Networks for Industrial Applications	Fog computing leverages the computational resources at the network edge to meet the increasing demand for latency-sensitive applications in large-scale industries. In this article, we study the computation offloading in a fog computing network, where the end users, most of the time, offload part of their tasks to a fog node. Nevertheless, limited by the computational and storage resources, the fog node further simultaneously offloads the task data to the neighboring fog nodes and/or the remote cloud server to obtain the additional computing resources. However, meanwhile, the offloaded tasks from the neighboring node incur burden to the fog node. Moreover, the task offloading to the remote cloud server can suffer from limited communication resources. Thus, to jointly optimize the amount of tasks offloaded to the neighboring fog nodes and communication resource allocation for the offloaded tasks to the remote cloud, we formulate a latency-driven task data offloading problem considering the transmission delay from fog to the cloud and service rate that includes the local processing time and waiting time at each fog node. The optimization problem is formulated as a quadratically constraint quadratic programming. We solve the problem by semidefinite relaxation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is effective and scalable under various simulation settings. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	35

The industrial bodies are trying to apply the sea clutter intelligent processing technology to the radar system with the form of Internet of Things and Industry 4.0. Many sea clutter reflectivity models that have been proposed are difficult to fully adapt to the surrounding seas and different radar systems in China. This article proposes a model named multi-source input neural network (MSINN) sea clutter model using sea clutter collected by ultra high frequency (UHF) radar. In order to prepare sea clutter reflectivity data for training MSINN, the radar continuously collects sea clutter containing various disturbances. In the face of the challenges of preprocessing and storage of measured sea clutter big data, this article proposes a sea clutter preprocessing scheme based on yolov3-tiny model. Experimental results show that the average detection precision of test sea clutter Range-Pulse (RP) images is 75.3% and the effective region extraction time of sea clutter RP image is 0.003642 s, which can meet the requirement of real-time detection and data requirement of predicting sea clutter reflectivity based on MSINN. Compared with the traditional empirical model, the average prediction error of sea clutter reflectivity based on MSINN is 1.82 dB, which improves the prediction accuracy and is more suitable for the Yellow Sea in China. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
797	A Trustworthy Privacy Preserving Framework for Machine Learning in Industrial IoT Systems	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing many leading industries such as energy, agriculture, mining, transportation, and healthcare. IIoT is a major driving force for Industry 4.0, which heavily utilizes machine learning (ML) to capitalize on the massive interconnection and large volumes of IIoT data. However, ML models that are trained on sensitive data tend to leak privacy to adversarial attacks, limiting its full potential in Industry 4.0. This article introduces a framework named PriModChain that enforces privacy and trustworthiness on IIoT data by amalgamating differential privacy, federated ML, Ethereum blockchain, and smart contracts. The feasibility of PriModChain in terms of privacy, security, reliability, safety, and resilience is evaluated using simulations developed in Python with socket programming on a general-purpose computer.

This integration was proposed to accelerate the adoption of intelligent transportation systems. The trustworthiness in VCs is expected to carry more computing capabilities that manage large-scale collected data. This trend requires a security evaluation framework that ensures data privacy protection, integrity of information, and availability of resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that proposes a robust trustworthiness evaluation of vehicular cloud for security criteria evaluation and selection. This article proposes three-level security features in order to develop effectiveness and trustworthiness in VCs. To assess and evaluate these security features, our evaluation framework consists of three main interconnected components: 1) an aggregation of the security evaluation values of the security criteria for each level; 2) a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making algorithm; and 3) a simple additive weight associated with the importance-performance analysis and performance rate to visualize the framework findings. The evaluation results of the security criteria based on the average performance rate and global weight suggest that data residency, data privacy, and data ownership are the most pressing challenges in assessing data protection in a VC environment. Overall, this article paves the way for a secure VC using an evaluation of effective security features and underscores directions and challenges facing the VC community.

This framework distributes captured data among multiple level-one edge devices (LOEDs) to improve the QoS and minimize packet drop and end-to-end delay. Mobile sinks are used to collect data from LOEDs and upload to cloud servers. Before data collection, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge-device to protect the underlying network. The privacy of mobile sinks is preserved through group-based signed data collection requests. Experimental results show that our proposed framework improves QoS through distributed data transmission. It also helps in protecting the underlying network through a registration scheme and preserves the privacy of mobile sinks through group-based data collection requests. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13

A complex fuzzy system-based thermography approach is proposed for predictive maintenance on electric railways.

807	Real-Time Anomaly Detection of NoSQL Systems Based on Resource Usage Monitoring	Today, the emergence of the industry revolution systems such as Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, and big data frameworks poses new challenges in terms of storage and processing of real-time data. As systems scale in humongous sizes, a crucial task is to administer the variety of different subsystems and applications to ensure high performance. This is directly related with the identification and elimination of system failures and errors, while the system runs. In particular, database systems may experience abnormalities related with decreased throughput or increased resource usage, that in turn affects system performance. In this article, we focus on not only SQL (NoSQL) database systems that are ideal for storing sensor data in the concept of Industry 4.0. This typically includes a variety of applications and workloads that are difficult to online monitor, thus making anomaly detection a challenging task. Creating a robust platform to serve such infrastructures with minimum hardware or software failures is a key challenge. In this article, we propose RADAR, an anomaly detection system that works on real time. RADAR is a data-driven decision-making system for NoSQL systems, by providing process information extraction during resource monitoring and by associating resource usage with the top processes, to identify anomalous cases. In this article, we focus on anomalies such as hardware failures or software bugs that could lead to abnormal application runs, without necessarily stopping system functionality, e.g., due to a system crash, but by affecting its performance, e.g., decreased database system throughput. Although different patterns may occur through time, we focus on periodic running workloads (e.g., monitoring daily usage) that are very common for NoSQL systems, and Internet of Things scenarios where data streams are forwarded to the Cloud for storage and processing. We apply various machine learning algorithms such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal ARIMA, and long-short-term memory recurrent neural networks. We experimentally analyze our solution to demonstrate the benefits of supporting online erroneous state identification and characterization for modern applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
808	Dynamic Resource Provisioning with Fault Tolerance for Data-Intensive Meteorological Workflows in Cloud	Cloud computing is a formidable paradigm to provide resources for handling the services from Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), such as meteorological industry. Generally, the meteorological services, with complex interdependent logics, are modeled as workflows. When any of the computing nodes for hosting the meteorological workflows fail, all sorts of consequences (e.g., data loss, makespan enlargement, performance degradation, etc.) could arise. Thus recovering the failed tasks as well as optimizing the makespan and the load balance of the computing nodes is still a critical challenge. To address this challenge, a dynamic resource provisioning method (DRPM) with fault tolerance for the data-intensive meteorological workflows is proposed in this article.

809	Intelligent UAV Identity Authentication and Safety Supervision Based on Behavior Modeling and Prediction	Since unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be controlled remotely in the absence of a unified means of identity authentication, they are quite vulnerable for illegal control by unidentifiable users. Only by tracing the identity of UAV itself, or providing management to pilots, current UAV identity authentication mechanism is far from achieving 'single machine for single person.'

A technology known as Internet of Things (IoT) is commonly referred to as the connectivity of Internet devices that provides the communication interactivity between the physical and the cyber objects. One of the key objectives of Internet computing is to simplify human activities and improve the user experience and device access. To explore its basic challenges, big data is somehow diversified into smart-data intelligence that transforms the raw semantic data into smart-data. The transformation approaches realize the significance of productivity and financial gain, which in turn offers a better decision-making process and privacy preservation. Moreover, the intelligent system collects raw data from different devices that analyze the extracted information. Since IoT plays a significant role in the development of a new source dataset, a seamless authentication protocol (SAP) is preferably chosen to coalesce data inference, algorithm development, and technological advancement. The comparative analysis proves that the proposed SAP consumes less computation and communication overhead as compared to other authentication schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
811	Integration of a Threat Traceability Solution in the Industrial Internet of Things	In industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios, where a plethora of IoT technologies coexist with consolidated industrial infrastructures, the integration of security mechanisms that provide protection against cyber-security attacks becomes a critical challenge. Due to the stealthy and persistent nature of some of these attacks, such as Advanced Persistent Threats, it is crucial to go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for the traceability of these attacks. In this sense, opinion dynamics poses a novel approach for the correlation of anomalies, which has been successfully applied to other network security domains. In this article, we aim to analyze its applicability in the IIoT from a technical point of view, by studying its deployment over different IIoT architectures and defining a common framework for the acquisition of data considering the computational constraints involved. The result is a beneficial insight that demonstrates the feasibility of this approach when applied to upcoming IIoT infrastructures. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
812	Mesoscale Particle Size Predictive Model for Operational Optimal Control of Bauxite Ore Grinding Process	This article investigates the use of a mesoscale kinetic model to cooperate with the operational optimal control of bauxite ore grinding process. In this article, we propose a new modeling framework where a discretized distributed parameter macroscale model and a mesoscale kinetic model are combined to predict the grinding product particle size. The mesoscale kinetic method does not need an explicit model of the process because it describes the process as a stochastic process. However, the high computational demand has prevented the kinetic model from using an online setting. We overcome this problem by embedding an acceleration algorithm based on the \tau-leap method. The proposed model is validated using experimental data. Finally, a solution of the bauxite ore grinding operational optimal control is proposed and the cooperation of the predictive model with other modular is demonstrated. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
813	Compound TCP Performance for Industry 4.0 WiFi: A Cognitive Federated Learning Approach	Understanding the performance of compound transmission control protocol (C-TCP) in wireless settings is complicated because of C-TCP's hybrid congestion control, and the complex interdependencies between losses due to wireless channel errors, medium access control (MAC)-layer collisions, and access point (AP) buffer overflows. In this article, we develop a comprehensive model to study the performance of long-lived C-TCP flows over Industry 4.0 WiFi infrastructure, taking all losses into account. Our mathematical model includes WiFi system parameters, such as the retransmissions limit and the AP buffer size, in order to see how they affect transport-layer throughput and fairness. More importantly, we extend the analytical model to multiple APs, and compare the performance of a dual AP scenario with a conventional single AP scenario. Our results show that using cognitive radio and federated learning techniques in the industrial multiple APs scenario can substantially improve the performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
814	Efficient and Privacy-Enhanced Federated Learning for Industrial Artificial Intelligence	By leveraging deep learning-based technologies, industrial artificial intelligence (IAI) has been applied to solve various industrial challenging problems in Industry 4.0. However, for privacy reasons, traditional centralized training may be unsuitable for sensitive data-driven industrial scenarios, such as healthcare and autopilot. Recently, federated learning has received widespread attention, since it enables participants to collaboratively learn a shared model without revealing their local data. However, studies have shown that, by exploiting the shared parameters adversaries can still compromise industrial applications such as auto-driving navigation systems, medical data in wearable devices, and industrial robots' decision making. In this article, to solve this problem, we propose an efficient and privacy-enhanced federated learning (PEFL) scheme for IAI. Compared with existing solutions, PEFL is noninteractive, and can prevent private data from being leaked even if multiple entities collude with each other. Moreover, extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the superiority of PEFL in terms of accuracy and efficiency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	163
815	EmIr-Auth: Eye Movement and Iris-Based Portable Remote Authentication for Smart Grid	With the development of Industry 4.0, the communication of smart grid has recently been taken seriously to ensure secure communication between operator and control center. However, the authentication process between them faces many challenges. Once the attacker successfully authenticated in the control center, the privacy data in the smart grid may leak and cause irreparable damage to the user. In addition, operator authentication is one of the most basic and crucial processes. Therefore, we propose the eye-movement and iris recognition based authentication (EmIr-Auth), a novel biometrics-based remote operator authentication scheme. EmIr-Auth uses the recorded eye-movement trajectory and randomly selected iris image to authenticate operators, which is beneficial in that it is able to get rid of many cryptographic computations, as well as the need to minimize message exchange. Furthermore, except for a high-resolution camera, we do not require any additional biometric sensors in this scheme. Using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, in this article, we demonstrate that our scheme provides secure authentication. Moreover, we analyze the attacks that EmIr-Auth can resist by informal security analysis. Experimental results show that EmIr-Auth is efficient enough to deploy on portable devices and reduce the overhead of authentication procedure. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
816	Secure Transmission of Compressed Sampling Data Using Edge Clouds	Cloud capability is considered to be extended to the edge of the Internet for improving the security of data transmission. Compressive sensing (CS) has been widely studied as a built-in privacy-preserving layer to provide some cryptographic features while sampling and compressing, including data confidentiality guarantees and data integrity guarantees. Unfortunately, most existing CS-based ciphers are too lightweight or highly complex to meet the requirements of both high security of transmitting the captured data over the Internet and low energy consumption of sensing devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this article, a secure transmission framework for CS data by combining CS-based cipher and edge computing is proposed. From the perspective of security, the double-layer encryption mechanism and double-layer authentication mechanism are rooted in it by performing some privacy-preserving operations, including CS-based encryption, CS-based hash, information splitting, strong encryption, and feature extraction. Most significantly, the proposed framework is very useful for resource-limited IoT applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25
817	Blockchain-Enabled Secure Energy Trading with Verifiable Fairness in Industrial Internet of Things	Energy trading in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a fundamental approach to realize Industry 4.0, plays a vital role in satisfying energy demands and optimizing system efficiency. Existing research works utilize a utility company to distribute energy to energy nodes with the help of energy brokers. Afterwards, they apply blockchain to provide transparency, immutability, and auditability of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. However, their schemes are constructed on a weak security model and do not consider the cheating attack initiated by energy sellers. Such an attack refers to an energy seller refusing to transfer the negotiated energy to an energy purchaser who already paid money. In this article, we propose FeneChain, a blockchain-based energy trading scheme to supervise and manage the energy trading process toward building a secure energy trading system and improving energy quality for Industry 4.0. Specifically, we leverage anonymous authentication to protect user privacy, and we design a timed-commitments-based mechanism to guarantee the verifiable fairness during energy trading. Moreover, we utilize fine-grained access control for energy trading services. We also build a consortium blockchain among energy brokers to verify and record energy trading transactions. Finally, we formally analyze the security and privacy of FeneChain and evaluate its performance (i.e., computational costs and communication overhead) by implementing a prototype via a local Ethereum test network and Raspberry Pi. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	78
818	Faster Authenticated Key Agreement with Perfect Forward Secrecy for Industrial Internet-of-Things	Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) is the basis of Industry 4.0, which extends Internet connectivity beyond traditional computing devices like computers and smartphones to the physical world for improving efficiency and accuracy while reducing the production cost. However, there are tremendous security threats to IIoT, such as IIoT device hijacking and data leaks. Therefore, a lightweight authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocol is commonly applied to establish a session key for securing the communication between IIoT devices. To protect the previous session keys from being compromised, perfect forward secrecy (PFS) has been one of the most important security properties of AKA. In this article, we present an efficient PFS-enabled AKA protocol for IIoT systems, which is developed based on a new dynamic authentication credential (DAC) framework, without using any public-key cryptographic primitives. It is worth noting that our protocol is also faster than the state-of-the-art DAC-based AKA protocols with PFS. Moreover, we give the formal security result of the proposed protocol in the random oracle model. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22
819	Edge-Computing-Based Channel Allocation for Deadline-Driven IoT Networks	Multichannel communication is an important means to improve the reliability of low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. Typically, data transmissions in IoT networks are often required to be delivered before a given deadline, making deadline-driven channel allocation an essential task. The existing works on time-division multiple access often fail to establish channel schedules to meet the deadline requirement, as they often assume that transmissions can be successful within one transmission slot. Besides, the allocation and link estimation incur considerable overhead for the IoT nodes. In this article, we propose an edge-based channel allocation (ECA) for unreliable IoT networks. In ECA, we explicitly consider the impact of allocation sequences and employ a recurrent-neural-network-based channel estimation scheme. We utilize link quality and retransmission opportunities to maximize the packet delivery ratio before deadline. The allocation algorithms are executed on edge servers such that: 1) the channel allocation can be updated more frequently to deal with the wireless dynamics; 2) the allocation results can be obtained in real time; and 3) channel estimation can be more accurate. Extensive evaluation results show that ECA can significantly improve the reliability of deadline-driven IoT networks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
820	Secure Metering Data Aggregation with Batch Verification in Industrial Smart Grid	Smart grid can greatly improve the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the traditional grids. In industrial smart grid, real-time user-side metering data may be frequently collected for monitoring and controlling electricity consumption. However, the procedure of frequently metering data collection may lead to sensitive information leakage. To address the security issues in industrial smart grid, in this article, we construct an efficient identity-based metering data aggregation scheme supporting batch verification by collector and electricity service provider, respectively, which guarantees the privacy and integrity of metering data. In our scheme, collectors are allowed to collect and aggregate the metering data of users in their respective administrative domain without compromising the confidentiality of metering data. Security analysis demonstrates that our proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle and satisfies the above security requirements. Performance analysis indicates that our scheme outperforms existing solutions in terms of communication and computation costs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19

However, this promising cyber technology can encounter serious security problems while accessing the internet. A malicious website can disguise itself as a normal website, and obtain users' private information. Thus, it is very important to detect malicious websites using tools such as machine learning (ML) algorithms, as these algorithms can help us to identify abnormal information hidden in the mass traffic more easily. Accordingly, many feature engineering tasks must be performed from memory, as a strong machine learning model is greatly improved with good features. In this article, we propose an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns URL embedding. We also explore some key parameters regarding a domain embedding model to obtain a good effect on domain features. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	40
822	AR-Net: Adaptive Attention and Residual Refinement Network for Copy-Move Forgery Detection	In copy-move forgery, the illumination and contrast of tampered and genuine regions are highly consistent, which poses a greater challenge in copy-move forgery detection. In this article, an end-to-end neural network is proposed based on adaptive attention and residual refinement network (AR-Net). Specifically, position and channel attention features are fused by the adaptive attention mechanism to fully capture context information and enrich the representation of features. Second, deep matching is adopted to compute the self-correlation between feature maps, and atrous spatial pyramid pooling fuses the scaled correlation maps to generate the coarse mask. Finally, the coarse mask is optimized through the residual refinement module, which retains the structure of object boundaries. Extensive experiments, evaluated on CASIAII, COVERAGE, and CoMoFoD datasets, demonstrate that the AR-Net has superior performance than state-of-the-art algorithms and can locate tampered and corresponding genuine regions at the pixel level. In addition, AR-Net has high robustness on postprocessing operations, such as noise, blur, and JPEG recompression. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	39

Fault location methods considering distribution phasor measurement unit (D-PMU) information and network symmetry characteristics are proposed. With the measurement information provided by the D-PMU, the fault sections and the fault types are determined by the phase difference between the positive and negative sequence currents. Different location algorithms are obtained based on the load symmetry of the distribution network. The fault location method based on the line distribution parameters is used for the three-phase symmetric system, and the fault location method based on line impedance is proposed for the three-phase asymmetric system. Finally, the effect of different nodes with a D-PMU on the fault location accuracy is analyzed, and the configuration principle of the D-PMU was proposed. The PSCAD/MATLAB simulation software is used to analyze the example and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate that high-precision fault location could be realized and that the practicality and economy are improved. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	36
824	Cognitive Optimal-Setting Control of AIoT Industrial Applications with Deep Reinforcement Learning	For industrial applications of the artificial intelligence of things, mechanical control usually affects the overall product output and production schedule. Recently, more and more engineers have applied the deep reinforcement learning method to mechanical control to improve the company's profit. However, the problem of deep reinforcement learning training stage is that overfitting often occurs, which results in accidental control and increases the risk of overcontrol. In order to address this problem, in this article, an expected advantage learning method is proposed for moderating the maximum value of expectation-based deep reinforcement learning for industrial applications. With the tanh softmax policy of the softmax function, we replace the sigmod function with the tanh function as the softmax function activation value. It makes it so that the proposed expectation-based method can successfully decrease the value overfitting in cognitive computing. In the experimental results, the performance of the Deep Q Network algorithm, advantage learning algorithm, and propose expected advantage learning method were evaluated in every episodes with the four criteria: the total score, total step, average score, and highest score. Comparing with the AL algorithm, the total score of the proposed expected advantage learning method is increased by 6% in the same number of trainings. This shows that the action probability distribution of the proposed expected advantage learning method has better performance than the traditional soft-max strategy for the optimal setting control of industrial applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14

To deal with this issue, in this article, we design a new efficient lightweight blockchain-enabled radio frequency identification (RFID)-based authentication protocol for supply chains in 5G mobile edge computing environment, called lightweight blockchain-enabled RFID-based authentication protocol (LBRAPS). LBRAPS is based on bitwise exclusive-or (XOR), one-way cryptographic hash and bitwise rotation operations only. LBRAPS is shown to be secure against various attacks. Moreover, the simulation-based formal security verification using the broadly-accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool assures that LBRAPS is secure. Finally, it is shown that LBRAPS has better trade-off among its security and functionality features, communication and computation costs as compared to those for existing protocols. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	88

We formulate the interactions among the macrocell base station and FUEs as a Stackelberg game to maximize the utilities of MUE and FUEs by obtaining the optimal power allocation and pricing strategy. Considering the uncertainty of channel gain which is expressed as a function of transmission distance, we propose a worst-case method to transform the uncertain optimization problem into a deterministic one. We then design two algorithms by considering the dynamics of FUEs, i.e., FUEs may join and leave femtocells. Numerical results verify the convergence and superior performance of our proposed algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	35

While deep neural networks can automatically extract features appropriate for the target task and focus on increasing the recognition performance, they cannot select important input sensor signals, which leads to the lack of interpretability. Since not all signals from wearable sensors are important for the target task, sensor signal importance will be insightful information for practitioners. In this article, we propose an interpretable and accurate convolutional neural network capable of select important sensor signals. This is enabled by spatially sparse convolutional filters whose sparsity is imposed by spatial group lasso. While there is a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability in a model, experimental results on the opportunity activity recognition dataset show that the proposed model can help improve recognition performance and select important sensor signals, providing interpretability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

However, the presence of noise affects severely the performance of such system. With the deployment of smart devices with microphones, one can form a powerful acoustic sensor network to enhance the speech via beamforming techniques. On the other hand, reliability of data transmission also determines the beamforming performance, since faulty data will drift the beamformer steering location randomly. Currently, there is no protection scheme for acoustic data transmitted over the wireless network in order to keep steady beamforming performance. In this article, we design a compound distributed beamformer, where nodes are grouped and the system is embedded with blockchain technology to protect the data integrity during transmission. It attempts to provide more possible reliable connections between groups.

The type of assistance provided by ankle exoskeletons could influence the lower leg muscle activities during human walking. This article aimed to systematically evaluate the lower leg muscle activities under different ankle exoskeleton assistance conditions. We measured multiple electromyography-based metrics of five lower leg muscles, while the participants walked with an ankle exoskeleton on a treadmill. Nine assistance conditions, which combined three peak times (46%, 49%, and 52% of stride time) and three peak torque levels (0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 N$\cdot$m$\cdot$kg$^{-1}$), are applied to assist plantarflexion during ankle push-off. Nine healthy subjects participated in the experiments. Of all investigated muscles, the activity level of l.SOL is influenced the most when exoskeleton assistance is applied. The root mean square of l.SOL activity reduces by 33.6 $\pm$ 14.0% under one assistance condition compared to walking without the exoskeleton.

Almost 75% of back injuries occur when lifting loads. In warehousing, agriculture, and construction, for example, workers are continuously handling loads manually. If incorrectly performed, these tasks put the workers at risk of back pain, injuries, and musculoskeletal disorders. Monitoring how the loads are lifted is key to quickly detecting which workers are showing dangerous behaviors, so that they can be (re)trained to perform the task safely, thereby reducing the risk of injury.

The system consists of a reflective safety jacket equipped with two barometric altimeters, a triaxial accelerometer, and a triaxial magnetometer. The sensors of the jacket continuously record these signals during the workday. The system then fuses the data from the two barometric altimeters in order to detect when the worker lifted loads. A neural classifier uses the signals recorded by the accelerometer and magnetometer to determine whether or not the task was performed safely.

Although ultrahigh-definition videos are now easily transmitted through mobile devices, video quality level that users perceive is generally lower than expected due to distance-based high latency between sources and end-users. Mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm is expected to address this issue and provide users with higher perceived quality of experience (QoE) for latency-critical applications, deploying MEC servers at edges. However, due to capacity concerns on MEC servers, a more comprehensive approach is needed to meet users' expectations applying all possible operations over the resources such as caching, prefetching, and task offloading policies depending on the data repetition or memory/CPU utilization. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel collaborative QoE-based mobility-aware video streaming scheme deployed at MEC servers. Throughout the article, we demonstrate how the proposed scheme can be implemented so as to preserve the desired QoE level per user during entire video sessions. Performance of the proposed scheme has been investigated by extensive simulations.

Through the application of the ground plane, the belt antenna achieves a maximum realized gain of 7.94 dBi and a minimum specific absorption rate of 0.04 W/kg at 0.5 W input power. During the design process, characteristic mode analysis is used to explore the underlining principle and further optimize the antenna performance. Two typical EBG structures are analyzed in detail for this application scenario. The suspended transmission line method is used to evaluate EBG performance variations when the textile ground plane is bent. A prototype of such a system is fabricated and tested.

In comparison to other cutting-edge methods using ECG signals, the proposed method shows superior BP estimation performance. By integrating with a wearable/portable ECG monitoring device, the proposed model can be deployed to an embedded system or remote healthcare intelligent system to provide long-term BP monitoring service, which would help to reduce the incidence of malignant events happened in hypertensive population. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
838	Dezert-Smarandache Theory-Based Fusion for Human Activity Recognition in Body Sensor Networks	Multisensor fusion strategies have been widely applied in human activity recognition (HAR) in body sensor networks (BSNs). However, the sensory data collected by BSNs systems are often uncertain or even incomplete. Thus, designing a robust and intelligent sensor fusion strategy is necessary for high-quality activity recognition. In this article, Dezert-Smarandache theory (DSmT) is used to develop a novel sensor fusion strategy for HAR in BSNs, which can effectively improve the accuracy of recognition. Specifically, in the training stage, the kernel density estimation (KDE)-based models are first built and then precisely selected for each specific activity according to the proposed discriminative functions. After that, a structure of basic belief assignment (BBA) can be constructed, using the relationship between the test data of unknown class and the selected KDE models of all considered types of activities.

839	Automated Decision Support System for Lung Cancer Detection and Classification via Enhanced RFCN with Multilayer Fusion RPN	Detection of lung cancer at early stages is critical, in most of the cases radiologists read computed tomography (CT) images to prescribe follow-up treatment. The conventional method for detecting nodule presence in CT images is tedious. In this article, we propose an enhanced multidimensional region-based fully convolutional network (mRFCN) based automated decision support system for lung nodule detection and classification. The mRFCN is used as an image classifier backbone for feature extraction along with the novel multilayer fusion region proposal network (mLRPN) with position-sensitive score maps being explored. We applied a median intensity projection to leverage three-dimensional information from CT scans and introduced deconvolutional layer to adopt proposed mLRPN in our architecture to automatically select the potential region of interest. Our system has been trained and evaluated using LIDC dataset, and the experimental results showed promising detection performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art nodule detection/classification methods, achieving a sensitivity of 98.1% and classification accuracy of 97.91%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23
840	Stochastic Modeling Based Nonlinear Bayesian Filtering for Photoplethysmography Denoising in Wearable Devices	Photoplethysmography (PPG) has shown its great potential for noninvasive health monitoring, but its application in wearable devices is largely impeded due to its extreme vulnerability to motion artifacts. In this article, we proposed a new stochastic modeling based nonlinear Bayesian filtering framework for the recovery of corrupted PPG waveform under strenuous physical exercise in wearable health-monitoring devices. A deep recurrent neural network was first recruited for accurate cardiac-period segmentation of corrupted PPG signals. Then, a stochastic model was applied to extract waveform details from clean PPG pulses, and was further derived into a system-state space. Following this was an extended Kalman filter using the state-space structured by modeling. The covariance of measurement noise was estimated by motion-related information to adjust it into the real physical environment adaptively. Comparison results with state-of-the-art methods on a wearable-device-based 48-subject data set showed the outstanding performance of the proposed denoising framework, with period-segmentation sensitivity and precision higher than 99.1%, instantaneous heart rate (HR) error lower than 2 beats/min, average HR error down to 1.14 beats/min, and recovery accuracy of waveform details significantly improved (p < 0.05). This framework is the first PPG denoising strategy that introduces waveform-modeling methods to ensure detail recovery, and a great example of algorithm fusion between stochastic signal processing and emerging deep learning methods for time-sequential biomedical signal processing. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8

842	Security-Aware Dynamic Scheduling for Real-Time Optimization in Cloud-Based Industrial Applications	Nowadays, large number of cloud-based techniques have been used in industrial control systems (ICS), which also brings many security threats. The emergence of security-aware industrial control has paved the way of security-aware scheduling in cloud-based industrial applications. Actually, most cloud-based industrial applications are time sensitive, which need real-time processing. Edge cloud computing paradigm extends the computing ability of traditional cloud model with low-latency local resources. Thus, heterogeneous clouds that consist of both centralized resources and edge resources may be a promising resource model to provide both scalable and low-latency resources for cloud-based industrial applications. In view of these challenges, in this article, we propose a security-aware dynamic scheduling method for real-time resource allocation in ICS. First, a three-level security model is designed for both tasks and cloud resources in ICS, and a two-tier heterogeneous cloud architecture is introduced. Accordingly, a security-aware scheduling method based on distributed particle swarm optimization is presented for resource allocation with security concerns. To deal with the dynamics of edge resources and the mobility of mobile industrial applications, a dynamic scheduling mechanism based on dynamic workflow model is proposed for real-time optimization. Experimental results validate that the scheduling control policy proposed in this article can achieve a good balance between scheduling performance and security performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19

845	Hierarchical Two-Stream Growing Self-Organizing Maps with Transience for Human Activity Recognition	The rapid growth in autonomous industrial environments has increased the need for intelligent video surveillance. As a predominant element of video surveillance, recognition of complex human movements is important in a wide range of surveillance applications. However, the current state-of-the-art video surveillance techniques use supervised deep learning pipelines for human activity recognition (HAR). A key shortcoming of such techniques is the inability to learn from unlabeled video streams. To operate effectively in natural environments, video surveillance techniques have to be able to handle huge volumes of unlabeled video data, monitor and generate alerts and insights derived from multiple characteristics such as spatial structure, motion flow, color distribution, etc. Furthermore, most conventional learning systems lack memory persistence capability which can reduce the influence of outdated information in memory-guided decision-making resulting in limiting plasticity and overfitting based on specific past events. In this article, we propose a new adaptation of the Growing Self-Organizing Map (GSOM) to address these shortcomings by 1) adopting two proven concepts of traditional deep learning, hierarchical, and multistream learning, applied into GSOM self-structuring architecture to accommodate learning from unlabeled video data and their diverse characteristics, 2) address overfitting and the influence of outdated information on neural architecture by implementing a transience property in the algorithm. We demonstrate the proposed model using three benchmark video datasets and the results confirm its validity and usability for HAR. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13

Based on the data classified as normal by the CI, a multivariate statistical process monitoring model for detecting chatter is constructed using the modified independent component analysis (MICA) method. The monitoring results show that the model based on the MICA outperforms other models based on the principal component analysis and independent component analysis. For the diagnosis of the cause variables of detected chatter, various contribution plots can be used. In this article, we develop a relative contribution plot for a more obvious diagnosis than the existing contribution plot.

Though, the scale and sensitivity degree of information continuously increases, giving rise to serious privacy concerns. The scope of this article is to provide efficient privacy preservation techniques, by tracking the correlation of multivariate streams recorded in a network of IIoT devices. The time-varying data covariance matrix is used to add noise that cannot be easily removed by filtering, generating obfuscated measurements and, thus, preventing unauthorized access to the original data. To improve communication efficiency between connected IoT devices, we exploit inherent properties of the correlation matrices, and track the essential correlations from a small subset of correlation values. Extensive simulation studies using constrained IIoT devices validate the robustness, efficiency, and effectiveness of our approach. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
848	Toward New Retail: A Benchmark Dataset for Smart Unmanned Vending Machines	Deep learning is a popular direction in computer vision and digital image processing. It is widely utilized in many fields, such as robot navigation, intelligent video surveillance, industrial inspection, and aerospace. With the extensive use of deep learning techniques, classification and object detection algorithms have been rapidly developed. In recent years, with the introduction of the concept of 'unmanned retail,' object detection, and image classification play a central role in unmanned retail applications. However, open-source datasets of traditional classification and object detection have not yet been optimized for application scenarios of unmanned retail. Currently, classification and object detection datasets do not exist that focus on unmanned retail solely. Therefore, in order to promote unmanned retail applications by using deep learning-based classification and object detection, in this article we collected more than 30 000 images of unmanned retail containers using a refrigerator affixed with different cameras under both static and dynamic recognition environments. These images were categorized into ten kinds of beverages. After manual labeling, images in our constructed dataset contained 155 153 instances, each of which was annotated with a bounding box. We performed extensive experiments on this dataset using ten state-of-the-art deep learning-based models. Experimental results indicate great potential of using these deep learning-based models for real-world smart unmanned vending machines. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
849	Short-Term Forecasting of Heat Demand of Buildings for Efficient and Optimal Energy Management Based on Integrated Machine Learning Models	The increasing growth in the energy demand calls for robust actions to design and optimize energy-related assets for efficient and economic energy supply and demand within a smart grid setup. This article proposes a novel integrated machine learning (ML) technique to forecast the heat demand of buildings in a district heating system. The proposed short-term (24h-ahead) heat demand forecasting model is based on the integration of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), imperialistic competitive algorithm (ICA), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model also embeds an ML-based feature selection (FS) technique combining binary genetic algorithm and Gaussian process regression to obtain the most important and nonredundant variables that can constitute the input predictor subset to the forecasting model. The model is developed using a two-year (2015-2016) hourly dataset of actual district heat demand obtained from various buildings in the Otaniemi area of Espoo, Finland. Several variables from different domains such as seasonality (calendar), weather, occupancy, and heat demand are used to construct the initial feature space for FS process. Short-term forecasting models are also implemented using the Persistence approach as a reference and other eight ML approaches: artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm combined with ANN (GA-ANN), ICA-ANN, SVM, GA-SVM, ICA-SVM, EMD-GA-ANN, and EMD-ICA-ANN. The performance of the proposed EMD-ICA-SVM-based forecasting model is tested using an out-of-sample one-year (2017) hourly dataset of district heat consumption of various building types. Comparative analysis of the forecasting performance of the models was performed. The obtained results demonstrate that the devised model forecasts the heat demand with improved performance evaluated using various accuracy metrics. Moreover, the devised model achieves outperformed forecasting accuracy enhancement, compared to the other nine evaluated models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23

Today, the most promising long-range communication technologies are LoRaWAN and Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT), which are driving a large IoT ecosystem. In this article, we evaluate the performance of LoRaWAN and NB-IoT with accurate in-field measurements using the same application context for a fair comparison in terms of energy efficiency, lifetime, quality of service, and coverage. The NB-IoT energy transmission is scarcely dependent on the payload length. Thus applications that can tolerate buffering and caching techniques on the node are favored. On the other hand, LoRaWAN consumes 10 × lower energy compared to NB-IoT for occasional and latency-sensitive communications, for which it enables much end-device lifetime. Finally, this paper provides design guidelines for future industrial applications with stringent requirements of long-range and low power wireless connectivity. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	40

Multiple-input-multiple-output filter bank multicarrier (MIMO-FBMC) communications employing offset quadrature amplitude modulation has been proposed for industrial big data due to its reliability and high spectrum efficiency. One of the difficulties in implementing a MIMO-FBMC system is accurate channel estimation (CE). The main factor affecting the CE performance is intrinsic imaginary interference, and the conventional preamble-based CE is not effective in this case. Thus, in this article, a low-complexity sparse adaptive CE scheme is proposed that is based on a dynamic threshold. This reduces the number of inner product calculations by considering only the columns of the measurement matrix greater than the threshold. Simulation results are presented that show that the proposed scheme is better than other well-known methods in terms of computational complexity and CE accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	34

Data clustering, a promising analytic technique is widely used to solve the IoT and big-data-based problems, since it does not require labeled datasets. Recently, metaheuristic algorithms have been efficiently used to solve various clustering problems. However, to handle big datasets produced from IoT devices, these algorithm fail to respond within the desired time due to high computation cost. This article presents a new metaheuristic-based clustering method to solve the big data problems by leveraging the strength of MapReduce. The proposed methods leverages the searching potential of military dog squad to find the optimal centroids and MapReduce architecture to handle the big datasets. The optimization efficacy the proposed method is validated against 17 benchmark functions, and the results are compared with five other recent algorithms, namely, bat, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony, multiverse optimization, and whale optimization algorithm. Furthermore, a parallel version of the proposed method is introduced using MapReduce [MapReduce-based MDBO (MR-MDBO)] for clustering the big datasets produced from industrial IoT. Moreover, the performance of MR-MDBO is studied on two benchmark UCI datasets and three real IoT-based datasets produced from industry.

859	Leveraging Energy Function Virtualization with Game Theory for Fault-Tolerant Smart Grid	As major infrastructures are increasingly depending on electricity, the smart grid has become an important base for industrial manufacturing and residential living. Despite the benefits of smart grids, the reliability and continuity of power services are often threatened by severe nature disasters and human errors. In smart grids, the centralized and often large-sized grid equipment hinder the rapid recovery and flexible reconfiguration in an emergency. Meanwhile, the large amount of personal equipment and their invisibility make it difficult for the grid operators to utilize assets optimally and easily. In addition, since the power service is provided by multiple energy functions, which consists voltage transformation, transmission, and storage, only considering the restoration of power generation function will restrict the service capacity and lengthen the response time. To address these problems, this article proposes an energy function virtualization for smart grid to decouple the implementation of energy functions from the underlying physical infrastructure to speed up the deployment and test of energy functions. With the help of distributed infrastructure resources, manager can redeploy energy functions and accelerate the service response in smart grid. To motivate prosumers to contribute private function resources, an optimized network calculus performance assessment scheme and a game theory-based resource orchestration scheme are proposed. Simulation results show that proposed scheme can dynamically adjust the delay factor to shorten the emergency response time. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10

867	Deep Double Supervised Embedding Neural Network Enhancing Class Separation for Visual High-Dimensional Industrial Process Monitoring	Visual process monitoring is the application of a visualization method to map the real-time operating information of an industrial process to a 2-D map, followed by process monitoring. However, owing to the complexity of industrial production processes and the complex correlations among industrial process variables, the structure and distribution of high-dimensional industrial data are very complicated. Therefore, a general visualization method cannot effectively separate the different fault data in a 2-D map for process monitoring. Accordingly, in this article, a deep double supervised embedding neural network (DDSE) is proposed for visualizing high-dimensional industrial data. The DDSE consists of two supervised deep neural networks: a deep class centres uniform distribution neural network (DCCUD), and a deep supervised t-stochastic neighbor embedding neural network (DSSNE). The DCCUD maps the high-dimensional industrial data to a new feature space in which the class centres obey a uniform distribution, promoting a good and separable situation for subsequent visualization procedures. The DSSNE then maps these high-dimensional features into a 2-D space. The training of the DDSE can be conducted through pre-training and fine-tuning. A proposed visual process monitoring approach combines the DDSE with the local outlier factor and k-nearest neighbor approaches.

868	NFV and Blockchain Enabled 5G for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications in Industry: Architecture and Performance Evaluation	5G networks are expected to provide cost-efficient, reliable, and flexible services for industrial productions and applications potentially, by introducing emerging network technologies like blockchain and network functions virtualization (NFV), which virtualizes network functions and runs them on standard infrastructure rather than customized hardware. However, how to deal with the emerging security challenges and fulfil the requirement of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) has not been fully resolved. In this article, we present an NFV-enabled 5G paradigm for the industry with the guarantee of URLLC through service chain acceleration and dynamic blockchain-based spectrum resource sharing among a variety of industry applications running in NVF-based equipment. First, we elaborate the benefits and shortcomings of NFV for industry, by executing an industry application experiment in virtualized and nonvirtualized data center networks. Then, we illustrate an NFV-enabled 5G paradigm for URLLC in detail, with a special focus on the service chain acceleration and spectrum sharing built on NFV, blockchain, software-defined networking, and mobile edge computing. Finally, we establish a mathematical model to study the worst-cast transmission latency of NFV-enabled 5G with the input of the bursty traffic. The proposed model can be exploited to support the plan, management, and optimization of NFV-enabled 5G URLLC systems for industry. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
869	Probabilistic Solar Irradiation Forecasting Based on Variational Bayesian Inference with Secure Federated Learning	The irradiation forecasting technology is important for the effective utilization of solar power. Existing irradiation forecasting methods have achieved excellent performance with a massive amount of data in a centralized way. However, concerns about privacy protection and data security, which may arise in the process of data collection and transmission from distributed points to the centralized server, pose challenges to current forecasting methods. In this article, a novel federated probabilistic forecasting scheme of solar irradiation is proposed based on deep learning, variational Bayesian inference, and federated learning (FL). In this scheme, the training data are stored and computed in local Internet of Things devices, only forecasting models are shared. Two real-world datasets from SolarGIS and National Solar Radiation Database, and one benchmark dataset of Folsom are used to verify the feasibility and performance of the federated-based scheme. Comprehensive case studies are conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed scheme in multihorizon. And the effects of using meteorological features and variational Bayesian inference are evaluated. Compared with other state-of-the-art probabilistic centralized models, when data can be shared, the proposed scheme achieves competitive forecasting performance on the basis of data privacy protection. When data sharing is unavailable, due to the cooperative nature inherent (model-sharing) of FL, the performance advantage of the proposed scheme is more obvious. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
870	Intelligent Detection for Key Performance Indicators in Industrial-Based Cyber-Physical Systems	Intelligent anomaly detection for key performance indicators (KPIs) is important for keeping services reliable in industrial-based cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, it is common in practice for various KPI sampling strategies to be utilized. We experimentally verify that anomaly detection is highly sensitive to irregular sampling, and accordingly go on to investigate low-cost anomaly detection for large-scale irregular KPIs. Irregular KPIs can be classified into four types: equal interval and unequal quantity (EIUQ) KPIs, unequal interval (UI) KPIs, unequal interval with equal duration (UIED) KPIs, and segmented irregular KPIs. In this article, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on these irregular types. Moreover, to handle the various lengths and phase shifts among EIUQ KPIs, we propose a normalized version of unequal cross-correlation, which slides the KPIs to enable finding the most similar position. To avoid high computational costs, we analyze the low-rank feature of KPIs data and propose a matrix factorization-based alignment algorithm for UIED KPIs; this algorithm treats UIED KPIs as an incomplete matrix and recovers the KPIs to align them before performing anomaly detection. Extensive simulations using three public datasets and two real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve a larger F1-score than Minkowski distance and less time than dynamic time warping distance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
871	Toward Secure Data Fusion in Industrial IoT Using Transfer Learning	As an emerging technology, the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can promote the development of industrial intelligence, improve production efficiency, and reduce manufacturing costs. In IIoT, the improvement and progress of industrial production and applications are inseparable from data fusion, a process that realizes the collection, analysis, and processing of the massive IoT data generated by industrial equipment and applications. IIot demands a real-time, effective, and privacy-preserving data fusion process. However, the existing works need to train different learning models for data analysis, which cannot meet real-time requirements in IIoT. Meanwhile, the lack of defense against internal attacks and the difficulty to balance system performance and privacy protection hinder the effectiveness and privacy protection in the data fusion process. To solve the abovementioned problems, in this article, we propose a new transfer learning-based secure data fusion strategy (TSDF) for IIoT. The proposed TSDF consists of three parts, guidance based deep deterministic policy gradient (GDDPG) algorithm for task classification, transfer learning based GDDPG for grouping of task receivers, and a multiblockchain mechanism for privacy preservation. The experiment results show that TSDF can achieve high system throughput and low latency, providing privacy preservation in data fusion under various IIoT application environments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15
872	Deep-Learning-Based App Sensitive Behavior Surveillance for Android Powered Cyber-Physical Systems	Android as an operating system is now increasingly being adopted in industrial information systems, especially with cyber-physical systems (CPS). This also puts Android devices onto the front line of handling security-related data and conducting sensitive behaviors, which could be misused by the increasing number of polymorphic and metamorphic malicious applications targeting the platform. The existence of such malware threats, therefore, call for more accurate identification and surveillance of sensitive Android app behaviors, which is essential to the security of CPS and Internet of Things (IoT) devices powered by Android. Nevertheless, achieving dynamic app behavior monitoring and identification on real CPS powered by Android is challenging because of restrictions from the security and privacy model of the platform. In this article, the authors investigate how the latest advances in deep learning could address this security problem with better accuracy. Specifically, a deep learning engine is proposed that detects sensitive app behaviors by classifying patterns of system-wide statistics, such as available storage space and transmitted packet volume, using a customized deep neural network based on existing models called Encoder and ResNet. Meanwhile, to handle resource limitations on typical CPS and IoT devices, sparse learning is adopted to reduce the amount of valid parameters in the trained neural network. Evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms a well-established group of baselines on time series classification in identifying sensitive app behaviors with background noise and the targeted behaviors potentially overlapping. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
873	SPDS: A Secure and Auditable Private Data Sharing Scheme for Smart Grid Based on Blockchain	The exponential growth of data generated from increasing smart meters and smart appliances brings about huge potentials for more efficient energy production, pricing, and personalized energy services in smart grids. However, it also causes severe concerns due to improper use of individuals' private data, as well as the lack of transparency and auditability for data usage. To bridge this gap, in this article, we propose a secure and auditable private data sharing (SPDS) scheme under data processing-as-a-service mode in smart grid. Specifically, we first present a novel blockchain-based framework for trust-free private data computation and data usage tracking, where smart contracts are employed to specify fine-grained data usage policies (i.e., who can access what kinds of data, for what purposes, at what price) while the distributed ledgers keep an immutable and transparent record of data usage. A trusted execution environment based off-chain smart contract execution mechanism is exploited as well to process confidential user datasets and relieve the computation overhead in blockchain systems. A two-phase atomic delivery protocol is designed to ensure the atomicity of data transactions in computing result release and payment. Furthermore, based on contract theory, the optimal contracts are designed under information asymmetry to stimulate user's participation and high-quality data sharing while optimizing the payoff of the energy service provider. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SPDS can effectively improve the payoffs of participants, compared with conventional schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24
874	Service Offloading with Deep Q-Network for Digital Twinning-Empowered Internet of Vehicles in Edge Computing	With the potential of implementing computing-intensive applications, edge computing is combined with digital twinning (DT)-empowered Internet of vehicles (IoV) to enhance intelligent transportation capabilities. By updating digital twins of vehicles and offloading services to edge computing devices (ECDs), the insufficiency in vehicles’ computational resources can be complemented. However, owing to the computational intensity of DT-empowered IoV, ECD would overload under excessive service requests, which deteriorates the quality of service (QoS). To address this problem, in this article, a multiuser offloading system is analyzed, where the QoS is reflected through the response time of services. Then, a service offloading (SOL) method with deep reinforcement learning, is proposed for DT-empowered IoV in edge computing. To obtain optimized offloading decisions, SOL leverages deep Q-network (DQN), which combines the value function approximation of deep learning and reinforcement learning. Eventually, experiments with comparative methods indicate that SOL is effective and adaptable in diverse environments. © 2020 IEEE	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42
875	A Novel Web Attack Detection System for Internet of Things via Ensemble Classification	Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the fastest-growing technologies and has been broadly applied in various fields. IoT networks contain millions of devices with the capability of interacting with each other and providing functionalities that were never available to us before. These IoT networks are designed to provide friendly and intelligent operations through big data analysis of information generated or collected from an abundance of devices in real time. However, the diversity of IoT devices makes the IoT networks' environments more complex and more vulnerable to various web attacks compared to traditional computer networks. In this article, we propose a novel ensemble deep learning based web attack detection system (EDL-WADS) to alleviate the serious issues that IoT networks faces. Specifically, we have designed three deep learning models to first detect web attacks separately. We then use an ensemble classifier to make the final decision according to the results obtained from the three deep learning models. In order to evaluate the proposed WADS, we have performed experiments on a public dataset as well as a real-word dataset running in a distributed environment. Experimental results show that the proposed system can detect web attacks accurately with low false positive and negative rates. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	43

877	Deep Reinforcement Learning for Edge Service Placement in Softwarized Industrial Cyber-Physical System	Future industrial cyber-physical system (CPS) devices are expected to request a large amount of delay-sensitive services that need to be processed at the edge of a network. Due to limited resources, service placement at the edge of the cloud has attracted significant attention. Although there are many methods of design schemes, the service placement problem in industrial CPS has not been well studied. Furthermore, none of existing schemes can optimize service placement, workload scheduling, and resource allocation under uncertain service demands. To address these issues, we first formulate a joint optimization problem of service placement, workload scheduling, and resource allocation in order to minimize service response delay. We then propose an improved deep Q-network (DQN)-based service placement algorithm. The proposed algorithm can achieve an optimal resource allocation by means of convex optimization where the service placement and workload scheduling decisions are assisted by means of DQN technology. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm, compared with existing algorithms, can reduce the average service response time by 8-10%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

Based on static network information and dynamic system responses, spatial correlations are first comprehensively described from both model-based and data-based viewpoints. Such correlations are further formulated as spatial attention factors, which are leveraged to carefully rectify multiple transient trajectories. Taking the rectified trajectories as inputs, the long short-term memory based deep recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm is employed to learn sequential SVS features. In this way, the RNN learning procedure is comprehensively guided by both spatial and temporal information, thereby deriving a highly reliable and robust classification model for online SVS assessment. Extensive numerical tests on the Nordic test system and the realistic Guangdong Power Grid in South China illustrate the superior reliability, scalability, and applicability of the proposed approach over existing methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
879	A Tensor-Based Multiattributes Visual Feature Recognition Method for Industrial Intelligence	Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) has revolutionized almost every aspect of industrial manufacturing through industrial intelligence by incorporating production equipment, mobile terminals, and smart devices with wireless or wired networks.

However, industrial visual information is heterogeneous and complex with multiattributes, which presents significant challenges on visual information perception and processing technologies such as multiattributes recognition method. In this article, to provide industrial intelligence, a tensor-based visual feature recognition method is used to recognize the object from the perspective of multiattributes with the combination of attributes. To demonstrate its practical implementation, a case study about the industrial intelligence on the faulty location and diameter of bearings in the IIoT is described.

881	A Reinforcement Learning-Based Network Traffic Prediction Mechanism in Intelligent Internet of Things	Intelligent Internet of Things (IIoT) is comprised of various wireless and wired networks for industrial applications, which makes it complex and heterogeneous.The openness of IIoT has led to the intractable problems of network security and management. Many network security and management functions rely on network traffic prediction techniques, such as anomaly detection and predictive network planning. Predicting IIoT network traffic is significantly difficult because its frequently updated topology and diversified services lead to irregular network traffic fluctuations. Motivated by these observations, we proposed a reinforcement learning-based mechanism in this article. We modeled the network traffic prediction problem as a Markov decision process, and then, predicted network traffic by Monte Carlo $Q$-learning. Furthermore, we addressed the real-time requirement of the proposed mechanism and we proposed a residual-based dictionary learning algorithm to improve the complexity of Monte Carlo $Q$-learning. Finally, the effectiveness of our mechanism was evaluated using the real network traffic. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
882	Visual-Guided Robotic Object Grasping Using Dual Neural Network Controllers	It has been a challenging task for a robotic arm to accurately reach and grasp objects, which has drawn much research attention. This article proposes a robotic hand-eye coordination system by simulating the human behavior pattern to achieve a fast and robust reaching ability. This is achieved by two neural-network-based controllers, including a rough reaching movement controller implemented by a pretrained radial basis function for rough reaching movements, and a correction movement controller built from a specifically designed brain emotional nesting network (BENN) for smooth correction movements. In particular, the proposed BENN is designed with high nonlinear mapping ability, with its adaptive laws derived from the Lyapunov stability theorem; from this, the robust tracking performance and accordingly the stability of the proposed control system are guaranteed by the utilization of the $H^{\infty }$ control approach. The proposed BENN is validated and evaluated by a chaos synchronization simulation, and the overall control system by object grasping tasks through a physical robotic arm in a real-world environment.

883	Unsupervised Saliency Detection of Rail Surface Defects Using Stereoscopic Images	Visual information is increasingly recognized as a useful method to detect rail surface defects due to its high efficiency and stability. However, it cannot sufficiently detect a complete defect in the complex background information. The addition of surface profiles can effectively improve this by including a 3-D information of defects. However, in high-speed detection, the traditional 3-D profile acquisition is difficult and separate from the image acquisition, which cannot satisfy the above-mentioned requirements effectively. Therefore, an unsupervised stereoscopic saliency detection method based on a binocular line-scanning system is proposed in this article. This method can simultaneously obtain a highly precise image as well as profile information while also avoids the decoding distortion of the structured light reconstruction method. In our method, a global low-rank nonnegative reconstruction algorithm with a background constraint is proposed. Unlike the low-rank recovery model, the algorithm has a more comprehensive low rank and background clustering properties. Furthermore, outlier detection based on the geometric properties of the rail surface is also proposed in this method. Finally, the image saliency results and depth outlier detection results are associated with the collaborative fusion, and a dataset (RSDDS-113) containing the rail surface defects is established for the experimental verification. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can obtain a mean absolute error of 0.09 and area under the ROC curve of 0.94, better than 15 state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	41
884	Edge-Cloud Computing for Internet of Things Data Analytics: Embedding Intelligence in the Edge with Deep Learning	Rapid growth in numbers of connected devices including sensors, mobile, wearable, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, is creating an explosion of data that are moving across the network. To carry out machine learning (ML), IoT data are typically transferred to the cloud or another centralized system for storage and processing; however, this causes latencies and increases network traffic. Edge computing has the potential to remedy those issues by moving computation closer to the network edge and data sources. On the other hand, edge computing is limited in terms of computational power, and thus, is not well-suited for ML tasks. Consequently, this article aims to combine edge and cloud computing for IoT data analytics by taking advantage of edge nodes to reduce data transfer. In order to process data close to the source, sensors are grouped according to locations, and feature learning is performed on the close by edge node. For comparison reasons, similarity-based processing is also considered. Feature learning is carried out with deep learning - the encoder part of the trained autoencoder is placed on the edge and the decoder part is placed on the cloud. The evaluation was performed on the task of human activity recognition from sensor data. The results show that when sliding windows are used in the preparation step, data can be reduced on the edge up to 80% without significant loss in accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	41
885	A Directed Edge Weight Prediction Model Using Decision Tree Ensembles in Industrial Internet of Things	As the application of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) becomes more widespread, the IIoT is being combined with social networks. Nodes in the network can be users, machines, and so on. Using the sensing detection technology of the IIoT, industrial machines can realize real-time informatization, which is convenient for users to perform remote management. Nodes can communicate with each other and make ratings. These ratings can be modeled as directed weighted edges between nodes and form directed weighted networks (DWNs). The edge weight represents the 'strength' of relationship and the direction of edge points from the edge generator to the edge receiver. Predicting edge weights in DWNs is critical to predicting unknown ratings or recovering lost data. In this article, we propose a directed edge weight prediction model (DEWP) using decision tree ensembles. It extends the local similarity indices to DWNs and extracts a series of similarity indices between nodes as features of each edge. These features are used to construct a blended regression model of random forest, gradient boost decision tree, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine. The proposed algorithm was evaluated experimentally with the Bitcoin OTC and Bitcoin Alpha datasets by removing 10% to 90% of edges in the original network. Compared with other classical algorithms, DEWP has higher prediction accuracy and robustness. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
886	Ensemble Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Soot Density Recognition	In each petrochemical plant around the world, the flare stack as a requisite facility produces a large amount of soot due to the incomplete combustion of flare gas, and this strongly endangers air quality and human health. Despite severe damages, the abovementioned abnormal conditions rarely occur, and, thus, only few-shot samples are available. To address such difficulty, in this article, we design an image-based flare soot density recognition network (FSDR-Net) via a new ensemble meta-learning technology. More particularly, we first train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) by applying the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm on a variety of learning tasks that are relevant to the flare soot recognition so as to obtain the general-purpose optimized initial parameters (GOIP). Second, for the new task of recognizing the flare soot density via only few-shot instances, a new ensemble is developed to selectively aggregate several predictions that are generated based on a wide range of learning rates and a small number of gradient steps. Results of experiments conducted on the density recognition of flare soot corroborate the superiority of our proposed FSDR-Net as compared with the popular and state-of-the-art deep CNNs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	39

Data compression methods can help achieving many tasks like providing data integrity, protection, as well as efficient transmission. Classical multimedia big data compression relies on methods like the spatial-frequency transformation for compressing with loss. Recent approaches use deep learning to further explore the limit of the data compression methods in communication constrained use cases like the Internet of Things (IoT). In this article, we propose a novel method to significantly enhance the transformation-based compression standards like JPEG by transmitting much fewer data of one image at the sender's end. At the receiver's end, we propose a two-step method by combining the state-of-the-art signal processing based recovery method with a deep residual learning model to recover the original data. Therefore, in the IoT use cases, the sender like edge device can transmit only 60% data of the original JPEG image without any additional calculation steps but the image quality can still be recovered at the receiver's end like cloud servers with peak signal-to-noise ratio over 31 dB. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	51
888	Weighted LIC-Based Structure Tensor with Application to Image Content Perception and Processing	As a famous visual content perception and processing tool, structure tensor has been widely studied in the past decades. Among them, the anisotropic nonlocal structure tensor (ANLST) has received much attention, recently. However, the existing ANLST calculation methods fail to fully utilize the anisotropic characteristic of the tensor field, thus resulting in limited performance. For this problem, in this article, we present a novel ANLST construction method, by means of combining tensor decomposition with weighted line integral convolution (LIC) with the aim at deeply discovering and exploiting the spatial direction relevancy of the tensors for their regularization. At first, the tensors decomposition, computed by direction projection, yields multiple atomic vector fields, from which, for each point in the tensor field we obtain a family of integral curves that are associated with spatial direction related tensors. Then, LIC is employed with the nonlocal means filtering to smooth the tensors relevant to each integral curve, giving rise to curve-level structure tensor (CLST). At last, a weighted average scheme is carried out on the multiple CLSTs, leading to our proposed weighted anisotropic nonlocal structure tensor (WANST). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WANST is superior to the current representative nonlinear structure tensors. The proposed WANST can be applied to industrial surveillance system to enable it perceive image contents, such as flat regions, corners, textures, and edges. In addition, WANST can also help monitoring system improve its image quality. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4

Besides, queuing models, imperfect channel state information, and vehicles' speeds are all considered.

891	An Anomaly Feature-Editing-Based Adversarial Network for Texture Defect Visual Inspection	Establishing a unified model for the defect inspection of different texture surfaces remains a challenge in the industrial automation field because these surfaces can vary in regular and irregular ways. Current unsupervised learning methods are trained on defect-free samples only and cannot directly address anomalies during testing, which precludes these methods from simultaneously inspecting for various texture defects. In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly feature-editing-based adversarial network (AFEAN) to accurately inspect various texture defects. To impart the AFEAN with the ability to address anomalies, a paired input, consisting of a defect-free image and an artificially defective image, is utilized for training. First, the AFEAN employs a feature extraction module (FEM) to extract latent features for the paired input. Subsequently, a novel anomaly feature detection module (AFDM) is proposed to detect anomaly features of the artificially defective image in the latent space. In the proposed AFDM, a novel central-constraint-based clustering method is proposed to detect anomaly features by learning the distribution of the latent features. Next, a novel global context feature editing module (GCFEM) is proposed to convert the detected anomaly features to normal features to suppress the reconstruction of defects. Finally, a feature decoding module (FDM) utilizes the edited features to reconstruct the texture background. Through the AFDM and GCFEM, the AFEAN achieves the ability to address anomaly features, effectively suppressing the reconstruction of defects on the texture background. In addition, to further improve the texture reconstruction accuracy, a pixel-level discrimination module (PDM) is employed to reconstruct texture details. In the testing phase, the defects are segmented by the residual image between the input image and the reconstructed texture background. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the AFEAN achieves the state-of-the-art inspection accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
892	A Novel Class Noise Detection Method for High-Dimensional Data in Industrial Informatics	The data in industrial informatics may be high-dimensional and mislabeled. Irrelevant or noisy features pose a significant challenge to the detection of high-dimensional mislabeling. The traditional method usually adopts a two-step solution, first finding the relevant subspace and then using it for mislabeling detection. This two-step method struggles to provide the optimal mislabeling detection performance, since it separates the procedures of feature selection and label error detection. To solve this problem, in this article, we integrate the two steps and propose a sequential ensemble noise filter (SENF). In the SENF, relevant features are selected and used to generate a noise score for each instance. Continuously, these noise scores guide feature selection in the regression learning. Thus, the SENF falls in the scope of sequential ensemble learning. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets with high dimensionality and much label noise. It is shown that the SENF is significantly better than other existing label noise detection methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5

The resource-constrained nature of wearable devices and their inability to support complex security mechanisms provide an ideal platform to malevolent entities for launching attacks. To preserve the privacy of wearable devices and their data in an I-CPS environment, in this article we propose a lightweight mutual authentication scheme. Our scheme is based on client-server interaction model that uses symmetric encryption for establishing secured sessions among the communicating entities. After mutual authentication, the privacy risk associated with a patient data is predicted using an AI-enabled hidden Markov model. We analyzed the robustness and security of our scheme using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. This analysis shows that the use of lightweight security primitives for the exchange of session keys makes the proposed scheme highly resilient in terms of security, efficiency, and robustness. Finally, the proposed scheme incurs nominal overhead in terms of processing, communication and storage and is capable to combat a wide range of adversarial threats. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	29
895	Data-Driven Multi-Energy Investment and Management under Earthquakes	Seismic events can severely damage both electricity and natural gas systems, causing devastating consequences. Ensuring the secure and reliable operation of the integrated energy system (IES) is of high importance to avoid potential damage to the infrastructure and reduce economic losses. This article proposes a new optimal two-stage optimization to enhance the reliability of IES planning and operation against seismic attacks. In the first stage, hardening investment on the IES is conducted, featuring preventive measures for seismic attacks. The second stage minimizes the expected operation cost of emergency response. The random seismic attack is modeled as uncertainty, which is realized after the first stage. An explicit damage assessment model is developed to define the budget set of the uncertain seismic activity. Based on the survivability of transmission lines and gas pipelines of IES, an optimal system investment plan is developed. The problem is formulated as a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model, which is tested on an integrated IEEE 30-bus system and 20-node gas network. Case studies demonstrate that the two-stage DRO outperforms robust optimization and a single-stage optimization model in terms of minimizing the investment cost and expected economic loss. This article can help system operators to make economical hardening and operation strategies to improve the reliability of IES under seismic attacks, thus managing a more robust and secure energy system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
896	Dynamic Network Function Provisioning to Enable Network in Box for Industrial Applications	Network function virtualization (NFV) in 6G can use standard virtualization techniques to enable network functions via software. Resource scheduling is one of the key research areas of NFV in 6G and is mainly used to deploy service function chains (SFCs) in substrate networks. However, determining how to utilize network resources efficiently has always been a difficult problem in SFC deployment. This article focuses on how to efficiently provision online SFC requests in NFV with 6G. We first establish a mathematical model for the problem of online SFC provisioning. Then, we propose an efficient online service function chain deployment (OSFCD) algorithm that selects the path to deploy that is close to the SFC length. Finally, we compare our proposed algorithm with three other existing algorithms by simulation experiments. The experimental results show that the OSFCD algorithm optimizes multiple performance indicators of online SFC deployment. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
897	Actively Exploring Informative Data for Smart Modeling of Industrial Multiphase Flow Processes	Accurate depiction of the process characteristics of dynamic multiphase flows using a data-driven model is a challenge in industrial practices. Collection of sufficient data is costly and cumbersome, and it is difficult to identify representative data efficiently. This paper develops an active learning method to explore information from multiphase flow process data, thus facilitating smart process modeling and prediction. An index is proposed to describe the process dynamics and nonlinearity using a probabilistic model, facilitating determination of informative data. The subsequent absorption of these data into the training set enhances the model quality gradually. This is relevant especially for transitional regions exhibiting dynamic information. In addition, a simple and efficient criterion to judge the learning termination has been designed. Consequently, new representative data are explored and learned in a sequential manner. The experimental results of two industrial multiphase flows demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. IEEE	2020	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
898	Fairness-Based Packing of Industrial IoT Data in Permissioned Blockchains	In recent years, blockchain has been broadly applied to industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to its features of decentralization, transparency, and immutability. In existing permissioned blockchain based IIoT solutions, transactions submitted by IIoT devices are arbitrarily packed into blocks without considering their waiting times. Hence, there will be a high deviation of the transaction response times, which is known as the lack of fairness. Unfair permissioned blockchain decreases the quality of experience from the perspective of the IIoT devices. Moreover, some transactions can get timeouts if not responded for a long time. In this article, we propose Fair-Pack, the first fairness-based transaction packing algorithm for permissioned blockchain empowered IIoT systems. First, we gain the insight that fairness is positively related to the sum of waiting times of the selected transactions through theoretical analysis. Based on this insight, we transform the fairness problem into the subset sum problem, which is to find a valid subset from a given set with subset sum as large as possible. However, it is time consuming to solve the problem using a brute-force approach because there is an exponential number of subsets for a given set. To this end, we propose a heuristic and a min-heap-based optimal algorithm for different parameter settings. Finally, we analyze the time complexity of Fair-Pack and conduct extensive experiments. The results reveal that Fair-Pack is time-efficient and outperforms the existing algorithms significantly in terms of both fairness and average transaction response time. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	36
899	Synergychain: Blockchain-assisted adaptive cyber-physical p2p energy trading	Industrial investments into distributed energy resource technologies are increasing and playing a pivotal role in the global transactive energy, as part of a wider drive to provide a clean and stable source of energy. The management of prosumers, which consume and as well as generate energy, with heterogeneous energy sources is critical for sustainable and efficient energy trading procedures. This article proposes a blockchain-assisted adaptive model, namely SynergyChain, for improving the scalability and decentralization of the prosumer grouping mechanism in the context of peer-to-peer energy trading. Smart contracts are used for storing the transaction information and for the creation of the prosumer groups. SynergyChain integrates a reinforcement learning module to further improve the overall system performance and profitability by creating a self-adaptive grouping technique. The proposed Synergy- Chain is developed using Python and Solidity and has been tested using Ethereum test nets. The comprehensive analysis using the hourly energy consumption dataset shows a 39.7% improvement in the performance and scalability of the system as compared to the centralized systems. The evaluation results confirm that SynergyChain can reduce the request completion time along with an 18.3% improvement in the overall profitability of the system as compared to its counterparts. © 2020 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
900	QR-3S: A High Payload QR Code Secret Sharing System for Industrial Internet of Things in 6G Networks	The communication in a 6G-enabled network in a box (NIB) needs to meet the characteristics of fast, convenient, and safe. Secret sharing scheme has become a hot topic nowadays due to unconditional security and simple decryption. At the same time, a quick response (QR) code as a popular carrier has been widely applied in various industrial applications because of the data payload and convenience. Thus, the combination of secret sharing and QR code provides a solution by satisfying the requirements of 6G-enabled NIB. In this article, we design a QR code secret sharing scheme with authentication to protect private data and prevent cheater. In this scheme, a secret image is first divided into a series of shadows based on a polynomial, and authentication bits are generated based on the generated shadows. Then shadows and the authentication bits are embedded into the cover QR codes according to the error correction redundancy and the homomorphism of the Reed-Solomon code in the QR code. In addition, the secret can be restored with the qualified shares and the authentication bits could verify the authenticity of the embedded shadows. Compared with existing schemes, the proposed scheme not only guarantees a high capacity but also embeds more authentication bits to improve the authentication ability. In addition, experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed scheme is both robust and secure. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
901	A Real-Time Edge Scheduling and Adjustment Framework for Highly Customizable Factories	In the context of new retail and personalized, small-batch, distributed collaborative production, orders arrive in real time, and each workshop needs to organize production lines based on suborders in real time under the constraints of smart contracts. However, the existing cloud centralized scheduling method has very high calculation and communication costs when inserting orders in real time, and the fully reactive edge scheduling method is difficult to meet the various order-level requirements of customers. Therefore, this article proposes a real-time edge scheduling model that considers real-time trial insertion of orders based on order-level requirements. Further, a real-time edge adjustment method to eliminate fluctuations is proposed. The proposed strategies were implemented using the lightest methods, avoiding cascading effects, to apply to the edge. Experimental results show that proposed strategies have significant advantages in order-level indicators such as customer satisfaction and have slightly better performance in workshop-level indicators such as resource utilization, energy consumption, and makespan. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4

We design Magnum for B5G-enabled scenarios to reduce the block transfer time. We formulate a demand-centric distribution scheme to further reduce the search and access time by adopting a nonlinear program model and solving it using the branch-and-bound method. Through extensive experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art solutions, we show that Magnum retains the accuracy of the models and present its feasibility with a maximum CPU and memory usage of 80% and 6%, respectively. Additionally, while Magnum requires a maximum of 10 s for writing models as large as 17 Mb on the blocks, it requires 16 ms for fetching the same. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
903	Multiscale Transfer Voting Mechanism: A New Strategy for Domain Adaption	Domain adaption models are widely applied to fault transfer diagnosis. However, the traditional domain adaption models can output only one high-dimensional transfer feature (TF); thus, it is difficult to capture domain-invariant information. Besides, using only one fully connected top classifier probably causes overfitting. Considering these two problems, in this article, we propose a multiscale transfer voting mechanism (MSTVM) to improve the classical domain adaption models and it can be universally applicable to any one of most domain adaption models. MSTVM consists of two substrategies: multiscale transfer mechanism (MSTM) and multiple transfer voting mechanisms (MTVM). The MSTM block includes several branches with multiscale convolutional and pooling operations, and it can output several multiscale TFs to strengthen the domain confusion. The MTVM block consists of multiple top classifiers and a plurality voting operation; thus, MTVM can effectively avoid overfitting and improve generalization ability. MSTVM has the advantages of MSTM and MTVM. Via two transfer diagnosis experiments, the advantage of MSTVM for improving various domain adaption models is verified. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9

However, individuals' privacy may be compromised because of data sharing. In this article, we study the differentially private data publishing problem, which aims at balancing between privacy and data utility. Specifically, two blockchain-based data publishing protocols are proposed. For histogram publishing, we propose a protocol where the Laplace noise added in the query result is verified by the blockchain. For anonymized data publishing, we propose a protocol, which can prevent the publisher and the recipient from lying about the utility of the published data. With the blockchain acting as a reliable intermediary between the publisher and the recipient, the proposed protocols can help to realize fair and auditable data sharing. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
905	Honeypot Identification in Softwarized Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems	In softwarized industrial networking, honeypot identification is very important for both the attacker and the defender. Existing honeypot identification relies on simple features of honeypot. There exist two challenges: The simple feature is easily simulated, which causes inaccurate results, whereas the advanced feature relies on high interactions, which lead to security risks. To cope with these challenges, in this article, we propose a secure fuzzy testing approach for honeypot identification inspired by vulnerability mining. It utilizes error handling to distinguish honeypots and real devices. Specifically, we adopt a novel identification architecture with two steps. First, a multiobject fuzzy testing is proposed. It adopts mutation rules and security rules to generate effective and secure probe packets. Then, these probe packets are used for scanning and identification. Experiments show that the fuzzy testing is effective and corresponding probe packet can acquire more features than other packets. These features are helpful for honeypot identification. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
906	Running Industrial Workflow Applications in a Software-Defined Multicloud Environment Using Green Energy Aware Scheduling Algorithm	Industry 4.0 have automated the entire manufacturing sector (including technologies and processes) by adopting Internet of Things and cloud computing. To handle the workflows from Industrial Cyber-Physical systems, more and more data centers have been built across the globe to serve the growing needs of computing and storage. This has led to an enormous increase in energy usage by cloud data centers, which is not only a financial burden but also increases their carbon footprint. The private software defined wide area network (SDWAN) connects a cloud provider's data centers across the planet. This gives the opportunity to develop new scheduling strategies to manage cloud providers workload in a more energy-efficient manner. In this context, this article addresses the problem of scheduling data-driven industrial workflow applications over a set of private SDWAN connected data centers in an energy-efficient manner while managing tradeoff of a cloud provider' revenue. Our proposed algorithm aims to minimize the cloud provider's revenue and the usage of nonrenewable energy by utilizing the real-world electricity prices with the availability of green energy on different cloud data centers, where the energy consumption consists of the usage of running application over multiple data centers and transferring the data among them through SDWAN. The evaluation shows that our proposed method can increase usage of green energy for the execution of industrial workflow up to 3\times times with a slight increase in the cost when compared to cost-based workflow scheduling methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
907	A Graph Neural Network-Based Digital Twin for Network Slicing Management	Network slicing has emerged as a promising networking paradigm to provide resources tailored for Industry 4.0 and diverse services in 5G networks.

Digital twin (DT) technology paves a way for achieving cost-efficient and performance-optimal management, through creating a virtual representation of slicing-enabled networks digitally to simulate its behaviors and predict the time-varying performance. In this article, a scalable DT of network slicing is developed, aiming to capture the intertwined relationships among slices and monitor the end-to-end (E2E) metrics of slices under diverse network environments. The proposed DT exploits the novel graph neural network model that can learn insights directly from slicing-enabled networks represented by non-Euclidean graph structures.

However, as an important part of communication security, key management for FANET currently depends heavily on the base station or infrastructures, which may easily become the attack target or increase the communication overheads of drones. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed key management scheme for heterogeneous FANET in this article, based on which drones can autonomously distribute cluster keys, update their public/private key pairs, migrate between clusters, and revoke malicious UAVs in a secure way.

Unfortunately, DT lacks a single publicly accepted narrative. In order to help researchers for building a common narrative about DT, we present an elaborated structure of DT, namely, spiral DTframework. Furthermore, for a secure and reliable management of the DT data, we propose using the blockchain technology rather than cloud or fog. As the classical blockchain suffers from transaction confirmation delays and is vulnerable to the quantum attacks, therefore, we propose a new variant of blockchain, namely twinchain, which is quantum-resilient and offers immediate transaction confirmation.

In this article, a hybrid neural network is proposed, named CovTANet, to provide an end-to-end clinical diagnostic tool for early diagnosis, lesion segmentation, and severity prediction of COVID-19 utilizing chest computer tomography (CT) scans. A multiphase optimization strategy is introduced for solving the challenges of complicated diagnosis at a very early stage of infection, where an efficient lesion segmentation network is optimized initially, which is later integrated into a joint optimization framework for the diagnosis and severity prediction tasks providing feature enhancement of the infected regions. Moreover, for overcoming the challenges with diffused, blurred, and varying shaped edges of COVID lesions with novel and diverse characteristics, a novel segmentation network is introduced, namely tri-level attention-based segmentation network. This network has significantly reduced semantic gaps in subsequent encoding-decoding stages, with immense parallelization of multiscale features for faster convergence providing considerable performance improvement over traditional networks. Furthermore, a novel tri-level attention mechanism has been introduced, which is repeatedly utilized over the network, combining channel, spatial, and pixel attention schemes for faster and efficient generalization of contextual information embedded in the feature map through feature recalibration and enhancement operations. Outstanding performances have been achieved in all three tasks through extensive experimentation on a large publicly available dataset containing 1110 chest CT-volumes, which signifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme at the current stage of the pandemic. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
911	Optimal Steady-State Voltage Control Using Gaussian Process Learning	In this article, an optimal steady-state voltage control framework is developed based on a novel linear voltage-power dependence deducted from Gaussian process (GP) learning. Different from other point-based linearization techniques, this GP-based linear relationship is valid over a subspace of operating points and, thus, suitable for a system with uncertainties such as those in power injections due to renewables. The proposed optimal voltage control algorithms, therefore, perform well over a wide range of operating conditions. Both centralized and distributed optimal control schemes are introduced in this framework. The least-squares estimation is employed to provide analytical forms of the optimal control, which offer great computational benefits. Moreover, unlike many existing voltage control approaches deploying fixed voltage references, the proposed control schemes not only minimize the control efforts but also optimize the voltage reference setpoints that lead to the least voltage deviation errors with respect to such setpoints. The control algorithms are also extended to handle uncertain power injections with robust optimal solutions, which guarantee compliance with the voltage regulation standards. As for the distributed control scheme, a new network partition problem is cast, based on the concept of effective voltage control source (EVCS), as an optimization problem which is further solved using convex relaxation. Various simulations on the IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus test feeders are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed voltage control algorithms and EVCS-based network partition. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7

A Siamese CNN encoding network is constructed to measure distances of input samples based on their optimized feature representations. A robust cost function design including three specific losses is then proposed to enhance the efficiency of training process. An intelligent anomaly detection algorithm is developed finally.

In this article, an artificial-intelligence-powered solution is presented to reach a full realization of SA covering perception, comprehension, and prediction, the last of which is more advanced but challenging and hence has not been discussed in any literature before. A novel SA model is proposed by aggregating two powerful deep learning structures: convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. The proposed CNN-LSTM model has superiority to achieve collaborative data mining on spatiotemporal measurement data, i.e., to learn both spatial and temporal features simultaneously from phasor measurement units data. Two functional branches are designed within the SA model: a contingency locator to detect the exact fault location at present and a stability predictor to predict stability status of the system in the future. Test results have shown high performance (accuracy) of the model even on a low level of data adequacy. The proposed SA model can promisingly facilitate very fast postfault actions by the system operators to prevent the power system from any unstable operational status. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
914	Facial Expression Recognition of Industrial Internet of Things by Parallel Neural Networks Combining Texture Features	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been widely applied in smart home, smart city, smart traffic, etc. It is a big challenge to recognize facial expression of IIoT systems more effectively. Current facial recognition methods only utilize singular facial images, so accurate features that are highly correlated with facial changes can hardly be extracted. In order to overcome this difficulty and improve facial expression recognition, in this article, we propose a parallel neural network combining texture features, which can be applied in facial expression recognition. This parallel neural network is constructed by convolution neural network, residual network, and capsule network. Additionally, texture analysis is conducted on facial expression images to extract abundant features. Eight texture features are extracted by gray-level co-occurrence matrix and integrated with features of original images. Finally, these integrated features extracted by three kinds of networks are used to classify facial images. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach has a high recognition rate and strong robustness compared to competitive algorithms. Remarkably, our accuracy reaches 98.14%, with an increase of 3.71% in comparison with ResNet, and the F1-score of 0.9801. It is thus verified from this result that the proposed algorithm has many outstanding advantages.

916	Enabling Secure Authentication in Industrial IoT with Transfer Learning Empowered Blockchain	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is ushering in huge development opportunities in the era of Industry 4.0. However, there are significant data security and privacy challenges during automatic and real-time data collection, monitoring for industrial applications in IIoT. Data security and privacy in IIoT applications are closely related to the reliability of users, which is determined by user authentication that have been widely used as an effective approach. However, the existing user authentication mechanisms in IIoT suffer from single factor authentication and poor adaptability with the rapid growth of the number of users and the diversity of user categories. To solve the aforementioned issues, this article proposes a novel Authentication mechanism based on Transfer Learning empowered Blockchain, coined ATLB. In ATLB, blockchains are applied to achieve the privacy preservation for industrial applications. In addition, by introducing the transfer learning based authentication mechanism, trustworthy blockchains are built such that the privacy preservation for industrial applications is further enhanced. Specifically, ATLB first employs a guiding deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to train the user authentication model of a specific region, which is then transferred locally for foreign user authentication or cross-regionally for another region's user authentication such that the model training time is significantly reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed ATLB not only provides accurate authentications for IIoT applications but also achieves high throughput and low latency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
917	Blockchain-Enhanced Data Sharing with Traceable and Direct Revocation in IIoT	The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) supports recent developments in data management and information services, as well as services for smart factories. Nowadays, many mature IIoT cloud platforms are available to serve smart factories. However, due to the semicredibility nature of the IIoT cloud platforms, how to achieve secure storage, access control, information update and deletion for smart factory data, as well as the tracking and revocation of malicious users has become an urgent problem. To solve these problems, in this article, a blockchain-enhanced security access control scheme that supports traceability and revocability has been proposed in IIoT for smart factories. The blockchain first performs unified identity authentication, and stores all public keys, user attribute sets, and revocation list. The system administrator then generates system parameters and issues private keys to users. The domain administrator is responsible for formulating domain security and privacy-protection policies, and performing encryption operations. If the attributes meet the access policies and the user's ID is not in the revocation list, they can obtain the intermediate decryption parameters from the edge/cloud servers. Malicious users can be tracked and revoked during all stages if needed, which ensures the system security under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and can resist multiple attacks. The evaluation has shown that the size of the public/private keys is smaller compared to other schemes, and the overhead time is less for public key generation, data encryption, and data decryption stages. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	117

Nevertheless, this is a challenging task since the existing DL models are hard to accurately express the complex semantics and attributes for those heterogeneous nodes and links in HGoT. To address this issue, we develop attention-aware encoder-decoder graph neural networks for HGoT, termed as HGAED. Specifically, we utilize the attention-based separate-and-merge method to improve the accuracy, and leverage the encoder-decoder architecture for implementation. In the heart of HGAED, the separate-and-merge processes can be encapsulated into encoding and decoding blocks. Then, blocks are stacked for constructing an encoder-decoder architecture to jointly and hierarchically fuse heterogeneous structures and contents of nodes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HGAED over state-of-the-art baselines. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6

The learning process operates in the data plane, where requests and responses for service are instantaneous. This facilitates the smoothing of the learning process to decide upon the possible resources and more precise service delivery without duplication.

920	Efficient Monocular Depth Estimation for Edge Devices in Internet of Things	As an essential part of Internet of Things, monocular depth estimation (MDE) predicts dense depth maps from a single red-green-blue (RGB) image captured by monocular cameras. Past MDE methods almost focus on improving accuracy at the cost of increased latency, power consumption, and computational complexity, failing to balance accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, when speeding up depth estimation algorithms, researchers commonly ignore their adaptation to different hardware architectures on edge devices. This article aims to solve these challenges. First, we design an efficient MDE model for precise depth sensing on edge devices. Second, We employ a reinforcement learning algorithm and automatically prune redundant channels of MDE by finding a relatively optimal pruning policy. The pruning approach lowers model runtime and power consumption with little loss of accuracy through achieving a target pruning ratio. Finally, we accelerate the pruned MDE while adapting it to different hardware architectures with a compilation optimization method. The compilation optimization further reduces model runtime by an order of magnitude on hardware architectures. Extensive experiments confirm that our methods are effective for images of different sizes on two public datasets. The pruned and optimized MDE achieves promising depth sensing with a better tradeoff among model runtime, accuracy, computational complexity, and power consumption than the state of the arts on different hardware architectures. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12

Due to the impact of the complex industrial environment, the transmission of video streaming is usually unstable. In the duration of a low bandwidth transmission, existing optimization methods often reduce the original resolution of some frames in a random way to avoid the video interruption. If the key frames with some important content are selected to be transmitted with a low resolution, it will greatly reduce the effect of industrial supervision. In view of this challenge, a real-time video streaming optimization method by reducing the number of video frames transmitted in the IIoT environment is proposed. Concretely, a deep learning-based object detection algorithm is recruited to effectively select the key frames in our method. The key frames with the original resolution will be transmitted along with audio data. As some nonkey frames are selectively discarded, it is helpful for smooth network transmitting with fewer bandwidth requirements. Moreover, we employ edge servers to run the object detection algorithm, and adjust video transmission flexibly. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness, and dependability of our method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
923	Edge Server Quantification and Placement for Offloading Social Media Services in Industrial Cognitive IoV	The automotive industry, a key part of industrial Internet of Things, is now converging with cognitive computing (CC) and leading to industrial cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV). As the major data source of industrial CIoV, social media has a significant impact on the quality of service (QoS) of the automotive industry. To provide vehicular social media services with low latency and high reliability, edge computing is adopted to complement cloud computing by offloading CC tasks to the edge of the network. Generally, task offloading is implemented based on the premise that edge servers (ESs) are appropriately quantified and located. However, the quantification of ESs is often offered according to empirical knowledge, lacking analysis on real condition of intelligent transportation system (ITS). To address the abovementioned problem, a collaborative method for the quantification and placement of ESs, named CQP, is developed for social media services in industrial CIoV. Technically, CQP begins with a population initializing strategy by Canopy and K-medoids clustering to estimate the approximate ES quantity. Then, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III is adopted to achieve solutions with higher QoS. Finally, CQP is evaluated with a real-world ITS social media data set from China. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	66
924	Concurrent Healthcare Data Processing and Storage Framework Using Deep-Learning in Distributed Cloud Computing Environment	Distributed cloud computing environments rely on sophisticated communication and sharing paradigms for ease of access, information processing, and analysis. The challenging characteristic of such cloud computing environments is the concurrency and access as both the service provider and end-user rely on the common sharing platform. In this article, retrieval and storage-based indexing framework (RSIF) is designed to improve the concurrency of user and service provider access to the cloud-stored healthcare data. Concurrency is achieved through replication-free and continuous indexing and time-constrained retrieval of stored information. The process of classifying the constraints for data augmentation and update is performed using deep learning for all the storage instances. Through conditional assessment, the learning process determines the approximation of indexing and ordering for storing and retrieval, respectively. This helps to reduce the time for access and retrieval concurrently, provided the process is not dependent. The simulation analysis using the metrics discontinuous indexing, replicated data, retrieval time, and cost proves the reliability of the proposed framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7

To elaborate, we first investigate the challenges and approaches in exploiting heterogeneous networks and multipath communication [e.g., using multipath transmission control protocol (MPTCP)] for the information technology cum operation technology (IT/OT) convergence in Industry 4.0. Based on the novel idea of intelligent and flexible manufacturing, we analyze the technical challenges of IT/OT convergence and then model network data traffics using MPTCP over the converged frameworks. It quantifies the adverse impact of network convergence on the performance for flexible manufacturing. We provide a few proof-of-concepts solutions; however, after a clear understanding of the tradeoffs, we discover the need for experience-driven MPTCP. The simulation result demonstrates that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the baseline schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
926	A Deep Swarm-Optimized Model for Leveraging Industrial Data Analytics in Cognitive Manufacturing	To compete in the current data-driven economy, it is essential that industrial manufacturers leverage real-time tangible information assets and embrace big data technologies. Data classification is one of the most proverbial analytical techniques within the cognitively capable manufacturing industries for finding the patterns in the structured and unstructured data at the plant, enterprise, and industry levels. This article presents a cognition-driven analytics model, CNN-WSADT, for the real-time data classification using three soft computing techniques, namely, deep learning [convolution neural network (CNN)], machine learning [decision tree (DT)], and swarm intelligence [wolf search algorithm (WSA)]. The proposed deep swarm-optimized classifier is a feature-boosted DT, which learns features using a deep convolution net and an optimal feature set built using a metaheuristic WSA.

927	A Deep Graph Neural Network-Based Mechanism for Social Recommendations	Nowadays, the issue of information overload is gradually gaining exposure in the Internet of Things (IoT), calling for more research on recommender system in advance for industrial IoT scenarios. With the ever-increasing prevalence of various social networks, social recommendations (SoR) will certainly become an integral application that provides more feasibly personalized information service for future IoT users. However, almost all of the existing research managed to explore and quantify correlations between user preferences and social relationships, while neglecting the correlations among item features which could further influence the topologies of some social groups. To tackle with this challenge, in this article, a deep graph neural network-based social recommendation framework (GNN-SoR) is proposed for future IoTs. First, user and item feature spaces are abstracted as two graph networks and respectively encoded via the graph neural network method. Next, two encoded spaces are embedded into two latent factors of matrix factorization to complete missing rating values in a user-item rating matrix. Finally, a large amount of experiments are conducted on three real-world data sets to verify the efficiency and stability of the proposed GNN-SoR. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	61
928	An Adaptive Trust Boundary Protection for IIoT Networks Using Deep-Learning Feature-Extraction-Based Semisupervised Model	The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms provides the industrial domain with many critical solutions, such as joint venture virtual production systems. However, the extensive interconnection of industrial systems with corporate systems in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks exposes the industrial domain to severe cyber risks. Because of many proprietary multilevel protocols, limited upgrade opportunities, heterogeneous communication infrastructures, and a very large trust boundary, conventional IT security fails to prevent cyberattacks against IIoT networks. Recent secure protocols, such as secure distributed network protocol (DNP 3.0), are limited to weak hash functions for critical response time requirements. As a complementary, we propose an adaptive trust boundary protection for IIoT networks using a deep-learning, feature-extraction-based semisupervised model. Our proposed approach is novel in that it is compatible with multilevel protocols of IIoT. The proposed approach does not require any manual effort to update the attack databases and can learn the rapidly changing natures of unknown attack models using unsupervised learnings and unlabeled data from the wild. Therefore, the proposed approach is resilient to emerging cyberattacks and their dynamic nature. The proposed approach has been verified using a real IIoT testbed. Extensive experimental analysis of the attack models and results shows that the proposed approach significantly improves the identification of attacks over conventional security control techniques. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
929	Social Image Sentiment Analysis by Exploiting Multimodal Content and Heterogeneous Relations	In the circumstance of social big data, sentiment analysis is attracting increasing attention for its capacity in understanding individuals' attitudes and feelings. Traditional sentiment analysis methods focus on single modality and become ineffective as enormous data are emerging on the social websites with multiple manifestations. In this article, multimodal learning approaches are proposed to capture the relations between image and text, which only stay at the region level and ignore the fact that the channels are also closely correlated with the semantic information. In addition, social images in the social platforms are closely connected by various types of relations, which are also conducice to sentiment classification but neglected by most existing works. In this article, we propose an attention-based heterogeneous relational model to improve the multimodal sentiment analysis performance by incorporating rich social information. Specifically, we propose a progressive dual attention module to capture the correlations between image and text, and then learn the joint image-text representation from the perspective of content information. A channel attention schema is proposed here to highlight semantically rich image channels and a region attention schema is further designed to highlight the emotional regions based on the attended channels. After that, we construct a heterogeneous relation network and extend graph convolutional network to aggregate the content information from social contexts as complements to learn high-quality representations of social images. Our proposal is thoroughly evaluated on two benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
930	Variational Graph Neural Networks for Road Traffic Prediction in Intelligent Transportation Systems	As one of the most important applications of industrial Internet of Things, intelligent transportation system aims to improve the efficiency and safety of transportation networks. In this article, we propose a novel Bayesian framework entitled variational graph recurrent attention neural networks (VGRAN) for robust traffic forecasting. It captures time-varying road-sensor readings through dynamic graph convolution operations and is capable of learning latent variables regarding the sensor representation and traffic sequences. The proposed probabilistic method is a more flexible generative model considering the stochasticity of sensor attributes and temporal traffic correlations. Moreover, it enables efficient variational inference and faithful modeling of implicit posteriors of traffic data, which are usually irregular, spatial correlated, and multiple temporal dependents. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed VGRAN model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while capturing innate ambiguity of the predicted results. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
931	A Blockchained Federated Learning Framework for Cognitive Computing in Industry 4.0 Networks	Cognitive computing, a revolutionary AI concept emulating human brain's reasoning process, is progressively flourishing in the Industry 4.0 automation. With the advancement of various AI and machine learning technologies the evolution toward improved decision making as well as data-driven intelligent manufacturing has already been evident. However, several emerging issues, including the poisoning attacks, performance, and inadequate data resources, etc., have to be resolved. Recent research works studied the problem lightly, which often leads to unreliable performance, inefficiency, and privacy leakage. In this article, we developed a decentralized paradigm for big data-driven cognitive computing (D2C), using federated learning and blockchain jointly. Federated learning can solve the problem of 'data island' with privacy protection and efficient processing while blockchain provides incentive mechanism, fully decentralized fashion, and robust against poisoning attacks. Using blockchain-enabled federated learning help quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections. Extensive evaluation and assessment findings demonstrate D2C's effectiveness relative to existing leading designs and models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	77
932	Multiple Kernel Driven Clustering with Locally Consistent and Selfish Graph in Industrial IoT	In the cognitive computing of intelligent industrial Internet of Things, clustering is a fundamental machine learning problem to exploit the latent data relationships. To overcome the challenge of kernel choice for nonlinear clustering tasks, multiple kernel clustering (MKC) has attracted intensive attention. However, existing graph-based MKC methods mainly aim to learn a consensus kernel as well as an affinity graph from multiple candidate kernels, which cannot fully exploit the latent graph information. In this article, we propose a novel pure graph-based MKC method. Specifically, a new graph model is proposed to preserve the local manifold structure of the data in kernel space so as to learn multiple candidate graphs. Afterward, the latent consistency and selfishness of these candidate graphs are fully considered. Furthermore, a graph connectivity constraint is introduced to avoid requiring any postprocessing clustering step. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
933	Fast and Accurate Convolution Neural Network for Detecting Manufacturing Data	This article introduces a technique known as clustering with particle for object detection (CPOD) for use in smart factories. CPOD builds on regional-based methods to identify smart object data using outlier detection, clustering, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and deep convolutional networks. The process starts by removing noise and errors from the images database by the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm. Next, the algorithm studies different correlations from the set of images in the database. This creates homogeneous, and similar clusters using the well-known k-means algorithm, and the FastRCNN (fast region convolutional neural network) uses these clusters to design efficient and more focused models. PSO is used to optimize the different parameters including, the number of neighbors of LOF, the number of clusters of k-means, the number of epochs, and the error learning rate for FastRCNN. The inference process benefits from the knowledge provided by training. Instead of considering a complex single model of the whole images database, we consider a simple homogeneous model. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, intensive experiments have been carried out on standard images database, and real smart manufacturer data. Our results show that CPOD when compared to baseline object detection solutions is superior in terms of runtime and accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
934	A Cognitive Joint Angle Compensation System Based on Self-Feedback Fuzzy Neural Network with Incremental Learning	Joint angle error of robotic arm has great impacts on the accuracy of the end-effector, which is critical in industrial applications. Therefore, in this article, an online cognitive joint angle error compensation method based on incremental learning is proposed to reduce joint angle error. The proposed method consists of a joint angle error solver and a compensation module, which ensure that the robot can obtain effective joint angle compensation in various situations. The joint angle error solver is used to solve joint angle error online. It uses the redundant constraint method for multilink position measurement so as to calculate the position error of the robot accurately later. The compensation module uses the self-feedback incremental fuzzy neural network (SFIFN) to predict and update the compensation in real time. SFIFN is a variant of the fuzzy neural network (FNN), which uses long short-term memory to introduce a feedback mechanism based on FNN. The incremental learning capability of SFIFN reduces the time for solving error and makes the module runs in real time. Specifically, two inertial measurement units mounted at the ends of links are used to measure pose changes of the ends of corresponding links. Both the simulated and the real experiments show that the proposed method yields good compensations to joint angle error and its potentials for smart manipulation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
935	Modeling of Human Cognition in Consensus Agreement on Social Media and Its Implications for Smarter Manufacturing	Opinion dynamics modeling has long been interesting to scientists because of its applications in the marketing industry as well as elections. Agreement, e.g., on a special product, has an affective influence on its manufacturing process. However, most of the existing opinion dynamics models are linear time invariant. In this article, eight non-linear time variant models for opinion dynamics are proposed and put to test on subjective synthetic networks. Despite all the efforts, the issues of stability and convergence in time-varying networks, which can be found in industrial contexts, have not been resolved yet and only sufficient conditions have been derived. In the proposed models, unlike in the classical ones such as the French-DeGroot model, we have taken into account each member's susceptibility to persuasion by others that is a cognitive parametric function of individuals' opinions. In addition, we have introduced a stubbornness matrix which has large values initially but shrinks to zero as the time grows. This implies that agents' susceptibilities to others, at the beginning of any experiment, are smaller than what they are at the end. We present a novel mathematical formulation for these new opinion dynamics models and prove their stability too. For evaluation, we simulated a scenario in which some people connected via a graph, voted for a product. They initially had their own stands but gradually came to a point found through interaction with the others. The results confirm the convergence and stability of the proposed models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

Nevertheless, due to the complexity and variability of the scenarios, higher requirements are imposed on the 6-DoF estimation. Among them, occlusion is one of the knottiest problems, which causes significant performance degradation and needs to be solved urgently. Therefore, in this article, we propose a completely new and universal multibranch network (MBN) for industrial applications. Our method is based on monocular vision system and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. First and foremost, it reduces occlusion interference by focusing on the physical area characteristics of the image. Compared with the traditional CNN-based method, it owns higher accuracy and lower estimation error under occlusion.

The massive amount of data in IIoT promote the development of deep learning-based health monitoring for industrial equipment. Since monitoring data for mechanical fault diagnosis collected on different working conditions or equipment have domain mismatch, models trained with training data may not work in practical applications. Therefore, it is essential to study fault diagnosis methods with domain adaptation ability. In this article, we propose an intelligent fault diagnosis method based on an improved domain adaptation method. Specifically, two feature extractors concerning feature space distance and domain mismatch are trained using maximum mean discrepancy and domain adversarial training respectively to enhance feature representation. Since separate classifiers are trained for feature extractors, ensemble learning is further utilized to obtain final results. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective and applicable in diagnosing faults with domain mismatch. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	138

At the other side, online education is gaining momentum and many universities are now offering online degrees. Content preparation for such programs usually involves recording the classes. In this article, we intend to introduce a deep learning-based camera management system as a substitute for the academic filming crew. The solution mainly consists of two cameras and a wearable gadget for the instructor. The fixed camera is used for the instructor's position and pose detection and the pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera does the filming. In the proposed solution, image processing and deep learning techniques are merged together. Face recognition and skeleton detection algorithms are used to detect the position of instructor. But the main contribution lies in the application of deep learning for instructor's skeleton detection and postprocessing of the deep network output for correction of the pose detection results using a Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator. This estimator is defined on a Markov state machine. The pose detection result along with the position info is then used by the PTZ camera controller for filming purposes. The proposed solution is implemented by using OpenPose which is a convolutional neural network for detection of body parts. Feeding a neural network pose classifier with 12 features extracted from the output of the deep network yields an accuracy of 89%.

943	A Sharding Scheme-Based Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm for Enhancing Security in Blockchain-Enabled Industrial Internet of Things	While the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can support efficient control of the physical world through large amounts of industrial data, data security has been a challenge due to various interconnections and accesses. Blockchain technology can support security and privacy preservation in IIoT data with its trusted and reliable security mechanism.

Early diagnosis and isolation are effective and imperative strategies for epidemic prevention and control. Most diagnostic methods for the COVID-19 is based on nucleic acid testing (NAT), which is expensive and time-consuming. To build an efficient and valid alternative of NAT, this article investigates the feasibility of employing computed tomography images of lungs as the diagnostic signals. Unlike normal lungs, parts of the lungs infected with the COVID-19 developed lesions, ground-glass opacity, and bronchiectasis became apparent.

945	Learning-Based Resource Allocation Strategy for Industrial IoT in UAV-Enabled MEC Systems	Forest fire monitoring plays an important role in forest resource protection. Although satellite remote sensing is an effective way for forest fire monitoring, satellite-based methods can only monitor large-scale forest areas, and they are weak in predicting the specific areas of forest fires. In this article, we first propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled system architecture consisting of multiple industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs), in which the data collected by sensors in IIoTs can be delivered to UAVs for processing directly. As the sensors of IIoTs are deployed to monitor different indexes of forest fires, fully considering the priority constraints among sensors can guarantee a quick response of forest fire monitoring. Thus, the priority constraints among the sensors are taken into consideration in this system architecture, and the objective is to minimize the maximum response time of forest fire monitoring. To search for the optimal UAV resource allocation strategy, a learning-based cooperative particle swarm optimization (LCPSO) algorithm with a Markov random field (MRF)-based decomposition strategy is proposed. The solution space of UAV resource allocation is decomposed into subsolution spaces according to the decomposed decision variables by the MRF network structure, and the optimal resource allocation strategy is searched by LCPSO in multiple subsolution spaces cooperatively. Three simulation experiments on two datasets are designed, and the simulation results compared with the state-of-the-art methods verify the validity of LCPSO, which are reflected by the quickest response time of forest fire monitoring. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23
946	Locating Inter-Turn Faults in Transformer Windings Using Isometric Feature Mapping of Frequency Response Traces	Power transformers usually confront various mechanical and electromagnetic stresses during an operation that may lead to defects in their windings. The short circuit in the windings is one of those severe defects. Early detection of short-circuits is necessary as extra heating in the shorted location can lead to progressive damage in windings insulation. Frequency response analysis (FRA) is a well-known method to diagnose short-circuits in transformers. Despite the accuracy of FRA, the interpretation of the obtained frequency response traces (FRTs) is still an intricate task. Due to the unknown impact of faults on FRTs, extracting efficient features from such traces is necessary for the interpretation of transformer's frequency response. In this article, an isometric feature mapping (Isomap) is used as a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique to locate interturn faults in transformer windings due to its capability of capturing the nonlinear phenomena in FRT of power transformers. It is revealed that, after constructing the isometric mapping for a transformer, there is no need for any expertise to detect fault location even in nondirect (high impedance) short-circuits. In other words, it can be the first step for the automated interpretation of FRA of power transformers. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

948	FastGNN: A Topological Information Protected Federated Learning Approach for Traffic Speed Forecasting	Federated learning has been applied to various tasks in intelligent transportation systems to protect data privacy through decentralized training schemes. The majority of the state-of-the-art models in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are graph neural networks (GNN)based for spatial information learning. When applying federated learning to the ITS tasks with GNN-based models, the existing frameworks can only protect the data privacy; however, ignore the one of topological information of transportation networks.

949	Exponential Stationary Subspace Analysis for Stationary Feature Analytics and Adaptive Nonstationary Process Monitoring	For real industrial processes, time-varying behaviors are quite common. Consequently, industrial processes usually possess nonstationary characteristics, which makes conventional monitoring methods suffer from the model mismatch problem. In this article, an exponential analytic stationary subspace analysis (EASSA) algorithm is proposed to develop an adaptive strategy for nonstationary process monitoring. It is recognized that although covered by nonstationary trends, some underlying components of the process may remain stationary, which can be used for reliable process monitoring. For this, an EASSA algorithm is first developed to estimate the stationary sources more accurately and numerically stably. Then, a monitoring strategy is developed on the estimated stationary sources to provide reliable monitoring results. Considering that the relationships between process variables are driven to change slowly by time-varying behaviors, an update strategy and an adaptive monitoring scheme are designed to accurately track the trajectory of nonstationary processes while reducing the update frequency as much as possible. To meet the need of the EASSA algorithm, the minimum update unit has been expanded from one sample to one batch and the update conditions are given, by which the model is prevented from erroneously adapting to incipient faults to a certain extent. Case study on both a simulation process and a real thermal power plant process demonstrates that the proposed method can distinguish the real faults from normal changes while being robust to the disturbances in the nonstationary process.

950	A Two-Stage Scheme for Both Power Allocation and EV Charging Coordination in a Grid-Tied PV-Battery Charging Station	Charging station that incorporates renewable energy resource and energy storage is a promising solution to meet the growing charging demand of electric vehicles (EVs) without the need to expand the distribution network. The aggregation of multiple energy resources and EVs requires an efficient and flexible energy management strategy. This article presents a two-stage scheme to solve the power allocation and charging coordination of plugged-in EVs. Game-theory-based control is utilized to address the interaction among different components for respecting their individual preferences. The first stage determines the power allocation of photovoltaic, battery, and the grid as well as total charging power for EVs. In the second stage, charging power dispatch among individual EVs is coordinated based on the available total charging power determined in the first stage. As a result, the two energy management problems of charging station are addressed sequentially. The proposed solution is validated via simulation and experiment, and the comparisons with benchmarks show its advantages. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
951	A Fair Incentive Scheme for Participation of Smart Inverters in Voltage Control	The increasing trend of renewable energy sources integration in the distribution systems may cause voltage fluctuations and voltage limit violations. The smart inverters with reactive power capability and active power curtailment (APC) control can solve the grid voltage issues. In this article, three-phase optimal power flow (TPOPF) is applied to dispatch the APC and reactive power injection (RPI) of inverters. The TPOPF takes smart meter measurements as inputs. The nonproportional APC and proportional APC are examined. In this article, a fair incentive scheme for APC by the inverters is proposed, appropriate for both utility and renewable energy producers. Similarly, unequal RPI and equal RPI by the inverters to maintain the system voltage are studied. The RPI incentive scheme is analyzed by accounting for the costs incurred in overrating of the inverters, power losses, and life reduction due to reactive power supplied by the inverters. The effective location of inverters for APC and RPI in the distribution network is explored. The incentive schemes are implemented in 27-node distribution system and IEEE European low-voltage distribution system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3

953	A Novel Image Steganography Method for Industrial Internet of Things Security	The rapid development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) brings new security threats by exposing secret and private data. Thus, information security has become a major concern in the communication environment of IIoT and AI, where security and privacy must be ensured for the messages between a sender and the intended recipient. In this article, we propose a method called Harris hawks optimization-integer wavelet transform (HHO-IWT) for covert communication and secure data in the IIoT environment based on digital image steganography. The method embeds secret data in the cover images using a metaheuristic optimization algorithm called HHO to efficiently select image pixels that can be used to hide bits of secret data within integer wavelet transforms. The HHO-based pixel selection operation uses an objective function evaluation depending on the following two phases: exploitation and exploration. The objective function is employed to determine an optimal encoding vector to transform secret data into an encoded form generated by the HHO algorithm. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method with respect to visual quality, payload capacity, and security against attacks. The obtained results reveal that the HHO-IWT method achieves higher levels of security than the state-of-the-art methods and that it resists various forms of steganalysis. Thus, utilizing this approach can keep unauthorized individuals away from the transmitted information and solve some security challenges in the IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22
954	A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the Wide-Area Damping Control Design	The presence of low-frequency and low-dampened oscillation modes can compromise the operating stability of power systems. Recent research has shown that the use of phasor measurement units data to compose a wide-area damping controller (WADC) has been shown to be effective in mitigating such oscillation modes but the possibility of loss of communication channels due to cyber-attacks or failures can compromise the proper operation of this controller.

956	Computing Resource Optimization of Big Data in Optical Cloud Radio Access Networked Industrial Internet of Things	Optical cloud radio access network (O-CRAN) is an emerging solution for IIoT, where numerous different devices/nodes are networked together. O-CRAN provides pool of shareable computing facility, equipped with hundreds of general-purpose processor (GPP). The GPPs process massive big data exerted by nodes via remote radio heads (RRHs), regarded as RRH-requests, which are bandwidth-intensive and deadline-constrained digitized base-band signals. Computing resource (CR) optimization has been widely investigated in O-CRAN. However, the existing optimizations may not guarantee workload and thermal balance among the active GPPs while satisfying RRH-request's deadline, which are necessary to efficiently leverage virtualization GPP capacity in a manner that provides the greatest uniform CR utilization (CRU). Due to varying network-load a single optimal solution does not exist. Therefore, in this article, we propose a modified-first-fit decreasing (MFFD) algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution for each time_stage. The MFFD evenly assigns RRH-requests among GPPs that maximizes individual CRU uniformly contrasting with FFD. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10

In this article, we consider radiology examination of using chest X-ray images, which is among the effective screening approaches for COVID-19 case detection. Given deep learning is an effective tool and framework for image analysis, there have been lots of studies for COVID-19 case detection by training deep learning models with X-ray images. Although some of them report good prediction results, their proposed deep learning models might suffer from overfitting, high variance, and generalization errors caused by noise and a limited number of datasets. Considering ensemble learning can overcome the shortcomings of deep learning by making predictions with multiple models instead of a single model, we propose EDL-COVID, an ensemble deep learning model employing deep learning and ensemble learning. The EDL-COVID model is generated by combining multiple snapshot models of COVID-Net, which has pioneered in an open-sourced COVID-19 case detection method with deep neural network processed chest X-ray images, by employing a proposed weighted averaging ensembling method that is aware of different sensitivities of deep learning models on different classes types. Experimental results show that EDL-COVID offers promising results for COVID-19 case detection with an accuracy of 95%, better than COVID-Net of 93.3%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42

However, the prediction task remains challenging due to the intermittent and chaotic character of RE sources, and the diverse user behavior and power consumers. This article presents a novel method for the prediction of RE generation and electricity load using improved stacked gated recurrent unit-recurrent neural network (GRU-RNN) for both univariate and multivariate scenarios. First, multiple sensitive monitoring parameters or historical electricity consumption data are selected according to the correlation analysis to form the input data. Second, a stacked GRU-RNN using a simplified GRU is constructed with improved training algorithm based on AdaGrad and adjustable momentum. The modified GRU-RNN structure and improved training method enhance training efficiency and robustness. Third, the stacked GRU-RNN is used to establish an accurate mapping between the selected variables and RE generation or electricity load due to its self-feedback connections and improved training mechanism. The proposed method is verified by using two experiments: prediction of wind power generation using multiple weather parameters and prediction of electricity load with historical energy consumption data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods of machine learning or deep learning in achieving an accurate energy prediction for effective smart grid operation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	41

962	Intelligent State Estimation for Continuous Fermenters Using Variational Bayesian Learning	Despite rapid sensor technology developments, monitoring a biological process using regular sensor measurements is challenging, making the process very difficult to characterize. Designing an optimal estimator is an attractive alternative to soft sensing for such complicated hybrid systems. In this paper, the variational Bayesian learning algorithms are proposed to estimate the continuous fermenters' actual states. Special attention is given to the random transition probability matrix (TPM), which is a prerequisite to improving estimation performance. Under the assumption of a time-invariant but random TPM, the Dirichlet distribution is utilized to specify the property of TPM. We then estimate it together with the system state and modal state to approximate the conditional posterior joint distribution. Testing the proposed algorithms using the fermenter model shows that the variational Bayesian learning algorithm can satisfactorily estimate conditions and track TPM in high accuracy.

In this article, a software-defined network (SDN) based on an analytical parallel routing framework is proposed by using the massive processing power of a graphics processing unit (GPU) for dynamically optimizing multiconstrained QoS parameters in the IIoT. The framework considers three types of QoS applications for smart healthcare traffic: loss-sensitive, delay-sensitive, and jitter-sensitive. A QoS-enabled routing optimization problem is formulated as a max-flow min-cost problem, while a greedy heuristic that dispatches the path calculation task concurrently to the GPU for calculating optimal forwarding paths considering the QoS requirement of each flow is proposed. The results show that the proposed scheme efficiently utilizes the limited bandwidth cost in terms of energy and bandwidth while satisfying the QoS requirement of each flow with maximizing the network resources for future IIoT traffic flows. Comparative analysis of simulation results with shortest path delay, Lagrangian relaxation-based aggregated cost, and Sway schemes indicate a reduced violation in the service-level agreement by 17%, 19%, and 4%, respectively, by using the AttMpls topology, while it is 48%, 44%, and 7% when the Goodnet topology is used. Moreover, SEQOS is seen to be energy efficient and eight times faster than the benchmark algorithms in large IIoT networks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

Existing multiagent cooperation methods focus on centralized training with decentralized execution, which is unsuitable for the edge-based distributed industrial scenarios. To harmonize distributed devices' actions and enhance the production efficiency, in this article, we propose an Interactive-Imitation-based Distributed Coordination (IIDC) algorithm. Specifically, we leverage the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) model to direct one agent's actions by following external professional demonstrations. We also adopt the self-imitation learning (SIL) model to direct one agent's potential actions by following its own previous good experiences. As the imperfect demonstrations in the GAIL-based interagent imitation process may degrade the imitation accuracy, we present a confidence-based matching method to reduce the gap between the professional and imitative behaviors. Furthermore, during the SIL-based intra-agent imitation process, the rewardless explorations also lead to nonoptimal imitation policy. We then present a Stein variational policy gradient based self-imitation method to learn an expected optimal policy. We validate the IIDC algorithm's effectiveness via the sequential assembly task. Evaluation results demonstrate that the IIDC algorithm can enhance the production efficiency evidently. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

977	A fourier-based phasor estimator with a modified moving average filter and its application in distribution networks	Phasor estimation is fundamental for most real-time analysis, monitoring, and control tasks in power systems. New applications on microgrids and active distribution networks make such estimation increasingly important, leading to many research efforts focusing on known approaches, such as the Fourier and cosine filters, to abate the estimation errors; others rely on newly applied algorithms like the Taylor-Kalman-Fourier filter (TKF). This variety has led to discussions about the application cases of each technique, normally demoting the Fourier filter (FF). In this spirit, the FF was reworked under the Hilbert space power theory, showing its conceptual correctness and then deriving an accurate and fast alternative relying on a discrete, lead-compensated filter. Such FF is tested over an active distribution network system, showing advantages in relevant scenarios, namely impedance estimation, grid-monitoring, and fault location. The proposal exhibits better dynamic performance and overshoot than the conventional techniques, with no increased complexity, and 'cleaner' results than the TKF, which is, however, faster to estimate the system's impedances. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5

980	INDFORG: Industrial Forgery Detection Using Automatic Rotation Angle Detection and Correction	Internet and other online media networks have emerged as the most important platforms for the sharing of digital information. However, the readily available editing tools provide an easy way for adversaries to manipulate the data and affect decision-making in various industrial applications. This malicious modification of the content, which has reduced the credibility of information delivery, is a commonly prevalent issue and hence needs serious attention. It also initiates an extreme need for industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS), which can compare the transferred and received images for correct orientation to ensure that it conveys meaningful information and assists in correct decision-making in industrial automation. In this article, we propose 'INDFORG', which employs a novel and highly accurate automatic rotation angle detection and correction algorithm (ARADC) for intelligent detection of forgery in industrial images. ARADC uses basic geometrical concepts, such as Pythagorean theorem and intensity correlation computation and works without any digital signature or watermark. It performs accurately even under several simultaneous signal-processing manipulations. The proposed framework detects the rotation angles blindly with a 99% accuracy rate for rotation up to ±89°. Experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient compared to various state-of-the-art approaches and is a preferred ICPS for trustworthy media delivery in industrial automation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4

Because they are chronic circulatory diseases, we should detect and prevent them in real time to minimize damage to human health. The ideal solution to overcome the problems of the clinical biochemical analyzer is to connect the biochemical sensor to the Internet.

In these cases, sensors deliver their data to remote estimators through wireless channels, which makes communication reliability a core issue. In this article, we propose an error-aware design to carry out network scheduling and channel allocation according to estimation error covariance and channel quality, with the aim of minimizing the total estimation error covariance. We develop multidimensional conflict graphs to model the interference and conflicts, and on this basis, a two-phase heuristic algorithm is further proposed to adaptively assign slots and channels at each superframe. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations are given to show the effectiveness of our error-aware design in preventing the estimation error covariance from diverging, and hence able to improve the accuracy of remote estimation and monitoring. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
983	A Novel Heavy-Tailed Mixture Distribution Based Robust Kalman Filter for Cooperative Localization	In cooperative localization for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the practical stochastic noise may be heavy-tailed, and nonstationary distributed because of acoustic speed variation, multipath effect of acoustic channel, and changeable underwater environment. To address such noise, a novel heavy-tailed mixture (HTM) distribution is first proposed in this article, and then expressed as a hierarchical Gaussian form by employing a categorical distributed auxiliary vector. Based on that, a novel HTM distribution based robust Kalman filter is proposed, where the one-step prediction, and measurement likelihood probability density functions are, respectively, modeled as an HTM distribution, and a Normal-Gamma-inverse Wishart distribution.

984	Variational LSTM Enhanced Anomaly Detection for Industrial Big Data	With the increasing population of Industry 4.0, industrial big data (IBD) has become a hotly discussed topic in digital and intelligent industry field. The security problem existing in the signal processing on large scale of data stream is still a challenge issue in industrial internet of things, especially when dealing with the high-dimensional anomaly detection for intelligent industrial application. In this article, to mitigate the inconsistency between dimensionality reduction and feature retention in imbalanced IBD, we propose a variational long short-term memory (VLSTM) learning model for intelligent anomaly detection based on reconstructed feature representation. An encoder-decoder neural network associated with a variational reparameterization scheme is designed to learn the low-dimensional feature representation from high-dimensional raw data. Three loss functions are defined and quantified to constrain the reconstructed hidden variable into a more explicit and meaningful form. A lightweight estimation network is then fed with the refined feature representation to identify anomalies in IBD. Experiments using a public IBD dataset named UNSW-NB15 demonstrate that the proposed VLSTM model can efficiently cope with imbalance and high-dimensional issues, and significantly improve the accuracy and reduce the false rate in anomaly detection for IBD according to F1, area under curve (AUC), and false alarm rate (FAR). © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	120
985	Charging Load Pattern Extraction for Residential Electric Vehicles: A Training-Free Nonintrusive Method	Extracting the charging load pattern of residential electric vehicle (REV) will help grid operators make informed decisions in terms of scheduling and demand-side response management. Due to the multistate and high-frequency characteristics of integrated residential appliances from the residential perspective, it is difficult to achieve accurate extraction of the charging load pattern. To deal with that, this article presents a novel charging load extraction method based on residential smart meter data to noninvasively extract REV charging load pattern. The proposed algorithm harnesses the low-frequency characteristics of the charging load pattern and applies a two-stage decomposition technique to extract the characteristics of the charging load. The two-stage decomposition technique mainly includes: the trend component of the charging load being decomposed by seasonal and trend decomposition using loess method, and the low-frequency approximate component being decomposed by discrete wavelet technology. Furthermore, based on the extracted characteristics, event monitoring, and dynamic time warping is applied to estimate the closest charging interval and amplitude. The key features of the proposed algorithm include 1) significant improvement in extraction accuracy; 2) strong noise immunity; 3) online implementation of extraction. Experiments based on ground truth data validate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing ones. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
986	Efficient Data Transmission Strategy for IIoTs with Arbitrary Geometrical Array	Various kinds of data are generated from industrial Internet of Things, and these data can be applied for connecting production equipment, identifying and locating items, etc. These data should be forwarded to the decision center for further analyses, especially in wartime. Thus, the channel status information (CSI) for industrial big data transmission has to be acquired. In this article, we develop a system architecture for industrial big data (BD) transmission based on radar-communication integration with arbitrary geometrical array. The traditional channel estimation method, which usually utilizes the regular antenna array to estimate the CSI, cannot be applied to the arbitrary geometrical array. Here, we use the manifold separation technique to transform the complex array configuration into regular array and the downlink channel covariance matrix is estimated by exploiting the frequency calibration technique when the uplink channel covariance matrix is received. The computational complexity for the proposed method and other state-of-the-art methods are analyzed. The simulation results prove that the proposed method can achieve excellent estimation performance for its application in radar-communication integration. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	29
987	Learning-Based Online Transmission Path Selection for Secure Estimation in Edge Computing Systems	Edge computing is emerged as a promising solution to cope with huge volumes of data generated by smart devices and low latency demand for mission-critical applications in industrial cyber-physical systems. Data processing and estimation are shifted to the edge computing side. Nevertheless, the WCN between field devices and edge computing side is exposed to malicious attackers because of its openness. Therefore, in this article, we focus on the transmission path selection strategy design to guarantee the secure state estimation on the edge side against dynamic denial-of-service attacks. First, we present a novel learning-based secure routing algorithm (LSRA) to learn the attack rule and predict the attacker's next conduct with the use of both historical and online data. With lower computational complexity, the proposed learning algorithm could track the attack rule in real time whenever new data comes. Meanwhile, we derive the analytical relationship between the probability upper bound of learning error and the learning time. Based on the predicted attacker's behavior obtained by the learning algorithm, we flexibly select the secure routing path to avoid being attacked and, thus, improve successful transmission probability. Furthermore, this secure routing path selection method improves the performance of the state estimation system. The theoretical analysis of estimator stability is given. Finally, simulation results reveal the effectiveness of LSRA and the path selection scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
988	A Real-Time Defect Detection Method for Digital Signal Processing of Industrial Inspection Applications	The signal processing of industrial big data (IBD) is a challenging task, owing to the complex working scenarios and the lack of annotations.

In our method, a module named feature collection and compression network is applied to merge multiscale feature information. Then, a new pooling method named Gaussian weighted pooling, which provides more precise location information, is used to replace region of interest (ROI) pooling. Experiment results show that our method gets improvements in both accuracy and efficiency, with mAP/\text{AP}_{50} of 41.8/80.2 at 33 fps on NEU-DET, which satisfies the requirement of real-time systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
989	An Adaptive Machine Learning Framework for Behind-the-Meter Load/PV Disaggregation	A significant amount of distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation is 'invisible' to distribution system operators since it is behind the meter on customer premises and not directly monitored by the utility. The generation essentially adds an unknown varying negative demand to the system, which causes additional uncertainty in determining the total load. This uncertainty directly impacts system reliability, cold load pickup, load behavior modeling, and hence cost of operation. Thus, it is essential to create low-complexity localized models for estimating power generation from these invisible sites behind the meters. This article proposes an adaptive machine learning framework to: a) learn using weather data and a minimal number of BTM PV generation measurement sensors, b) forecast PV generation using weather, location of PV, and trained ML model at location for unmeasured BTM PV; c) use estimated PV and net load measured by smart meter or smart transformer to estimate total true load at each time step; and d) learn the specific load patterns eventually to adapt localized models. The proposed framework's core idea is to transform the data such that: a) the machine learning model can effectively utilize the time dependency of measurements; and b) the measurements are transformed into a lower dimensional space to reduce complexity while maintaining accuracy. The transformed measurements are then used to train the machine learning models for load/PV disaggregation. Machine learning models investigated include linear regression, decision tree, random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron. The proposed framework's efficacy is demonstrated using two datasets, a real dataset from Hawaii and a simulated dataset using detailed models in GridLab-D. Several test/training split scenarios, including 90-10% split, one-month-out, one-season-out, and panel-independent split are presented to provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed framework. Results on both datasets show that the proposed framework can estimate PV generation with high accuracy using low-complexity methods. The accuracy results are comparable to higher complexity models (e.g., deep architectures), and RF is found to provide superior performance with these specific datasets compared to the other ML models investigated. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10

First, infrared thermal images are collected and used to characterize the health condition of rotor-bearing system. Second, modified CNN is developed by introducing stochastic pooling and Leaky rectified linear unit to overcome the training problems in classical CNN. Finally, parameter transfer is used to enable the source modified CNN to adapt to the target domain, which solves the problem of limited available training data in the target domain. The proposed method is applied to analyze thermal images of rotor-bearing system collected under different working conditions. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other cutting edge methods in fault diagnosis of rotor-bearing system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	111
991	Clone Detection Based on BPNN and Physical Layer Reputation for Industrial Wireless CPS	Industrial wireless cyber-physical systems are vulnerable to malicious node attacks, for example, clone node attack. The existing clone detection schemes are either based on upper layer observations or physical layer channel state information. The schemes based on upper layer observations are vulnerable to defamation while the schemes based on channel state information perform better against defamation, but are badly affected by channel conditions. This article applies physical layer reputation and back propagation neural network to clone detection, aiming at improving the detection accuracy. The proposed scheme accumulates the physical layer reputations by channel state information and input them to the neural network. The cloud server performs attack detection by group detection first. If a certain group is classified as attacked, the corresponding edge processor will perform attack tracing to identify the specific clone nodes. During the attack tracing stage, multiple reputations of each node is adopted for a comprehensive inspection. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Universal Software Radio Peripheral platform. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the detection accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6

Electroencephalography (EEG)-based fatigue detection can be a good way to reduce accidents and improve safety and efficiencies throughout the transportation system. In this article, we focus on investigating whether the spatial-temporal changes in the relations between EEG channels are specific to different driving states. EEG signals were first partitioned into several segments, and the covariance matrices obtained from each segment were input into a recurrent neural network to extract high-level temporal features. Meanwhile, the covariance matrices of whole signals were leveraged to extract spatial characteristics that were fused with temporal features to obtain comprehensive spatial-temporal information. In experiments on an open benchmark dataset, our method achieved an excellent classification accuracy of 89.28% and showed superior performance compared to several other state-of-the-art methods. These results indicate that our method can enable higher performance in driver fatigue detection. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
993	A Data-Driven Auto-CNN-LSTM Prediction Model for Lithium-Ion Battery Remaining Useful Life	Integration of each aspect of the manufacturing process with the new generation of information technology such as the Internet of Things, big data, and cloud computing makes industrial manufacturing systems more flexible and intelligent. Industrial big data, recording all aspects of the industrial production process, contain the key value for industrial intelligence. For industrial manufacturing, an essential and widely used electronic device is the lithium-ion battery (LIB). However, accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of LIB is urgently needed to reduce unexpected maintenance and avoid accidents. Due to insufficient amount of degradation data, the prediction accuracy of data-driven methods is greatly limited. Besides, mathematical models established by model-driven methods to represent degradation process are unstable because of external factors like temperature. To solve this problem, a new LIB RUL prediction method based on improved convolution neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), namely Auto-CNN-LSTM, is proposed in this article. This method is developed based on deep CNN and LSTM to mine deeper information in finite data. In this method, an autoencoder is utilized to augment the dimensions of data for more effective training of CNN and LSTM. In order to obtain continuous and stable output, a filter to smooth the predicted value is used. Comparing with other commonly used methods, experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	90
994	Wide-Attention and Deep-Composite Model for Traffic Flow Prediction in Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems	Recently, traffic flow prediction has drawn significant attention because it is a prerequisite in intelligent transportation management in urban informatics. The massively available traffic data collected from various sensors in transportation cyber-physical systems brings the opportunities in accurately forecasting traffic trend. Recent advances in deep learning shows the effectiveness on traffic flow prediction though most of them only demonstrate the superior performance on traffic data from a single type of vehicular carriers (e.g., cars) and does not perform well in other types of vehicles. To fill this gap, in this article, we propose a wide-attention and deep-composite (WADC) model, consisting of a wide-attention module and a deep-composite module, in this article. In particular, the wide-attention module can extract global key features from traffic flows via a linear model with self-attention mechanism. The deep-composite module can generalize local key features via convolutional neural network component and long short-term memory network component. We also perform extensive experiments on different types of traffic flow datasets to investigate the performance of WADC model.

995	Task Allocation Strategy for MEC-Enabled IIoTs via Bayesian Network Based Evolutionary Computation	The industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) are well deployed to monitor pollutant emissions or device statuses in the industrial factory, especially in the chemical plants. To give a quick response of monitoring results, the industrial big data generated by IIoTs containing various tasks need to be processed as soon as possible. However, the priority constraints among the tasks generated by sensors are not considered in the existing architectures, which may result in the delayed response. Thus, in this article, we propose a mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled architecture considering the priority constraints among tasks with the objective to minimize the response time. The tasks can be executed in MEC servers or cloud servers based on task complexity. Traditional methods search the optimal task allocation strategy through a set of initial strategies and a optimizer without the consideration of relationship among tasks. Thus, we propose a Bayesian network based evolutionary algorithm (BNEA) for optimizing a task allocation strategy. To fully consider the priority among tasks, the BNEA studies a Bayesian network based decomposition strategy in which the tasks are decomposed based on the relationship reflected by the learned Bayesian network structure. The BNEA searches the optimal task allocation strategy with the help of decomposed tasks cooperatively. Moreover, we propose a probability-based update strategy for particles to avoid draping into local optima. The experimental results verify that the BNEA can achieve the best response time through the corresponding task allocation strategy, which means that the data generated from the IIoTs can be transmitted to the destination in the shortest time. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
996	Data-Driven Deep Learning for Signal Classification in Industrial Cognitive Radio Networks	With the proliferation of mobile access services and wireless devices, spectrum resources are increasingly becoming scarce. Industrial wireless sensor networks may have to share frequency bands with other systems and suffer from considerable interference. To address that, industrial cognitive radio networks (ICRNs) were developed for effective spectrum sharing, where signal classification is a fundamental and important technology, especially for industrial wireless devices, which need to identify suspicious transmissions. In this article, a novel framework of signal intelligent classification is proposed based on deep learning networks in ICRNs. In the proposed framework, wireless signals will be preprocessed first by Choi-Williams distribution time-frequency analysis and represented by two-dimensional time-frequency images. Then, features of wireless signals are extracted through stack hybrid autoencoders (SHAEs). To accommodate general cases, we design multiple signal classification methods, including unsupervised, semisupervised, and supervised methods, which are processed by Softmax function, semisupervised linear discriminant function, and Fisher discriminant function, respectively. Finally, simulation studies are conducted and the corresponding simulation results show that the proposed framework is able to learn hierarchical features accurately and achieve excellent signal classification performance. Moreover, it can effectively overcome the negative impact caused by feature parameters uncertainty. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23

In a fog computing platform, fog nodes can provide the distributed and proximity resources for the tasks related to intelligent manufacturing.

However, traditional deployment strategies cannot satisfy the performance requirements of intelligent manufacturing systems. In this article, the problem of the fog nodes deployment is studied and a fog nodes deployment strategy based on the space-time characteristics (TSBP) is proposed. A fog nodes deployment system model is set up and the objective function of the fog nodes deployment is built up, in which the optimization goal is to minimize the computing response time and realize the load balancing of the fog nodes. In addition, the discrete differential evolution algorithm is applied to search the optimal fog nodes deployment solution.

998	Evaluating Docker for Lightweight Virtualization of Distributed and Time-Sensitive Applications in Industrial Automation	A trend, accompanying the change of automation systems and their architectures, is the virtualization of software components. Virtualization strengthens platform-independent development and the provision of secure and isolated applications. Virtualization introduces well-defined interfaces to strengthen modularity, which facilitates the scalability of applications. However, virtualization includes additional software components and layers and, thus, additional computing costs. This additional effort can conflict with the real-time requirements of automation processes. Current research lacks the investigation of the time behavior of container-based virtualizations concerning their use in real-time systems. An assessment concerning real-time applications is required to prepare it for use in industrial automation. This article examines the effects of virtualization on the time delays of a software component based on Docker containers by providing measurements on a hardware testbed in a realistic use case.

999	Support Multimode Tensor Machine for Multiple Classification on Industrial Big Data	Supervised machine learning algorithms, especially classification algorithms, have been widely used in data analysis of industrial big data. Among them, the support vector machine (SVM) has achieved great success in the binary classification of some areas like image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition. However, an SVM cannot achieve the desirable classification results for heterogeneous and high-dimensional data generated from thousands of industrial sensors in physical environments, because the traditional vector-based and feature-aligned SVM algorithm may result in loss of structural information and rich context information. Although the support tensor machine (STM) has extended the traditional vector-based SVM to tensor space, it fails to deal with multiple classification problems. Therefore, designing a general multiple classification algorithm for heterogeneous and high-dimensional data is a challenging but promising topic. To achieve this goal, this article presents a support multimode tensor machine (SMTM) algorithm by applying the multimode product to generalize the formulation of the STM. Furthermore, this article presents an efficient algorithm to train the parameters. Experiments conducted on various data sets validate the better performance of the SMTM over other algorithms in the multiple classification and imply the potential of the proposed model for multiple classification on industrial big data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13

1001	LoRa beyond ALOHA: An Investigation of Alternative Random Access Protocols	In this article, we present a stochastic geometry-based model to investigate alternative medium access choices for LoRaWAN - a widely adopted low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology for the Internet-of-Things. LoRaWAN adoption is driven by its simplified network architecture, air interface, and medium access. The physical layer, known as Long Range (LoRa), provides quasi-orthogonal virtual channels through spreading factors (SFs) and time-power capture gains. However, the adopted pure ALOHA access mechanism suffers, in terms of scalability, under the same-channel same-SF transmissions from a large number of devices. In this article, our objective is to explore access mechanisms beyond-ALOHA for LoRaWAN. Using recent results on time- and power-capture effects of LoRa, we develop a unified model for the comparative study of other choices, i.e., slotted ALOHA and carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA). The model includes the necessary design parameters of these access mechanisms, such as guard time and synchronization accuracy for slotted ALOHA, carrier sensing threshold for CSMA. It also accounts for the spatial interaction of devices in annular shaped regions, characteristic of LoRa, for CSMA. The performance metrics derived from the model in terms of coverage probability, channel throughput, and energy efficiency are validated using Monte-Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that slotted ALOHA indeed has higher reliability than pure ALOHA but at the cost of lower energy efficiency for low device densities. Whereas, CSMA outperforms slotted ALOHA at smaller SFs in terms of reliability and energy efficiency, with its performance degrading to pure ALOHA at higher SFs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	33

As such, the RDT will be instrumental in mirroring targeted properties of a physical robot to obtain a digital sibling flexibly harnessed in virtual testbeds to understand, predict, and shape the robot performance. However, these objectives remain challenging to well-established simulators. This is because the architectural and functional capabilities they support are not sufficiently in-line with ever-growing and varying demands for agile and cost-efficient manipulations. As a consequence, robot stakeholders can hardly use RDTs to unlock opportunities and meet needs from prospective markets. This article contributes to addressing this gap.

However, it is still difficult to analyze and estimate the real-time structural and environmental parameters in terms of their dynamic changes in digital twinning, especially when facing detection tasks of multiple small objects from a large-scale scene with complex contexts in modern manufacturing environments. In this article, we focus on a small object detection model for DT, aiming to realize the dynamic synchronization between a physical manufacturing system and its virtual representation. Three significant elements, including equipment, product, and operator, are considered as the basic environmental parameters to represent and estimate the dynamic characteristics and real-time changes in building a generic DT system of smart manufacturing workshop. A hybrid deep neural network model, based on the integration of MobileNetv2, YOLOv4, and Openpose, is constructed to identify the real-time status from physical manufacturing environment to virtual space. A learning algorithm is then developed to realize the efficient multitype small object detection based on the feature integration and fusion from both shallow and deep layers, in order to facilitate the modeling, monitoring, and optimizing of the whole manufacturing process in the DT system. Experiments and evaluations conducted in three different use cases demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our proposed method, which can achieve a higher detection accuracy for DT in smart manufacturing. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society.

1006	Improved particle swarm optimization based selective harmonic elimination and neutral point balance control for three-level inverter in low-voltage ride-through operation	In high-power applications, selective harmonic elimination pulsewidth modulation (SHEPWM) method is widely used to eliminate low-order harmonics in three-level inverters with low power losses. However, it faces the challenges that the conventional optimization methods for solving harmonic elimination equations in SHEPWM are easy to be trapped in local optimum. Moreover, the neutral point (NP) voltage of three-level inverter cannot be balanced under low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) condition with conventional SHEPWM method. To address these problems, a SHEPWM scheme is proposed, which is on the basis of an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm to solve the harmonic elimination equations and an enhanced NP balance control method in LVRT operation. First, an IPSO algorithm is proposed to calculate the switching angles of the transcendental equations for harmonic elimination. The IPSO algorithm defines a nonlinear negative exponential inertia weight considering the current and optimal fitness value, which can dynamically adjust the local and global searching speed and step size according to the actual situation, greatly improving the convergence speed and solution accuracy and avoiding falling into the local optimum. Then, by increasing the degree of freedom of the output current direction and combining with the NP voltage deviation, an enhanced NP voltage balance control method of SHEPWM in LVRT operation is proposed. The validity of the proposed method is proved by simulation and experimental results. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
1007	Smart meters enabling voltage monitoring and control: The last-mile voltage stability issue	This article investigates the voltage monitoring and control feature for smart meters and identifies the impact of this feature on both power distribution and communication systems. Regarding the voltage monitoring, a cosimulation platform is developed using GridLAB-D and ns-3 to analyze the impact of adding voltage measurements to smart meter readings and assess the mitigation strategies for reducing timeout errors and packet drops of smart meter data. Regarding the voltage control, a new voltage stability control scheme is developed, which applies the voltage stability margin as the control objective, instead of the traditional voltage magnitude. The proposed control scheme makes use of existing advanced metering infrastructure and distributed energy resources (DERs), requiring small marginal costs. It is indicated that integrating the voltage monitoring and control feature, smart meters could enable the voltage stability issues being solved at end-user sides, i.e., the 'last-mile' segment. It is also implied that the new feature could support the coordination of the local and system-level voltage controls using both customer-owned and utility-scale DERs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7

1009	Decision-Making Model for Securing IoT Devices in Smart Industries	The industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) is a powerful Internet of Things (IoT) application that enables industrial growth by ensuring transparent communication among the various entities of a company such as the manufacturing locations, design hubs, and packaging units. However, current industrial architectures are unable to efficiently deal with advanced security issues that come with this communication due to the distributed and expandable nature of IIoT networks. Furthermore, from a security perspective, malicious devices with the objective of modifying data from within the premises of the network pose a high risk for the IIoT. Therefore, introducing intelligent decision-making models to the IIoT can enhance our ability to examine any collected data in a more structured, efficient, and secure manner. In this article, we provide a decision-making model for securing IIoT data. The proposed model, based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution, can provide secure information transmission and recording/storage using various communicating parameters. The degree of trust of the IoT devices is analyzed using these parameters. Simple additive weighting is integrated into the proposed model to remove inefficient and ill-structured parameters. The proposed model is validated using various spectrum sensing and security parameters against a baseline method for the IIoT. Simulation results show that the proposed model is approximately 85% more efficient in identifying malicious nodes and denial-of-service threats compared to the baseline method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18
1010	Adaptive Nonconvex Sparsity Based Background Subtraction for Intelligent Video Surveillance	Intelligent video surveillance is a vital technique in smart city construction, where detection of surveillance objects is generally achieved by subtracting estimated background from the raw video. Common wisdom of background estimation focuses on introducing meaningful structure or discriminative hypothesis to sparsity-based objectives. However, relaxation optimization, which is always considered a most effective solution, definitely leads to information loss. So, in this article, as to preserve more information, a new nonconvex sparsity model that can be solved directly by explicit solution is proposed for the stationary component of video. The solution, called generalized shrinkage thresholding operator, is designed by integrating the advantages of three common shrinkage operators. Then, for the regularly changing patterns, a purified dictionary learning operation is designed to find self-repeating texture patches. Eventually, foreground objects are detected by combining background subtraction with a spatiotemporal continuity constraint. Besides, built on optimizations of both models, we then show the way to refine the joint estimates using alternative optimization of all the subproblems. Experimental results have shown that, as to foreground detection task, when compared against current state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed model achieves comparable and often superior performance in terms of F-measure scores in most cases. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10
1011	An Attribute-Based Access Control for Cloud Enabled Industrial Smart Vehicles	Smart cities' vision will encompass connected industrial vehicles, which will offer data-driven and intelligent services to the user. Such interaction within dispersed connected objects are sometimes referred as the industrial Internet-of-Vehicles (IIoV). The prime motivation of an intelligent transportation system (ITS) is ensuring the safety of the drivers and offering a comfortable experience to the user. However, such complex infrastructures opens broad attack surfaces to the adversaries, which can remotely exploit and control the critical mechanics in the smart vehicles, including engine and brake systems. Security and privacy concerns are significant barriers to the wide adoption of this revolutionary technology that has to be addressed before a comprehensive implementation of the real vision of ITS. This article is a stepping stone to address access control issues in the IIoV ecosystem and propose a formal attribute-based access control system (referred to ITS-ABAC\mathrm{_G}). The proposed model introduces the notion of groups, which are assigned to various smart entities based on the different attributes. It also offers the implementation of fine-grained security policies and considers individualized privacy preferences along with system-wide policies to accept or reject notification, alerts, and advertisements from different participating smart entities. We present the prototype implementation of our proposed model in the Amazon Web Services IoT platform together with extensive performance to reflect the practicality and wide-scale adoption of the proposed system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19
1012	Lightweight Searchable Encryption Protocol for Industrial Internet of Things	Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) has suffered from insufficient identity authentication and dynamic network topology, thereby resulting in vulnerabilities to data confidentiality. Recently, the attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes have been regarded as a solution to ensure data transmission security and the fine-grained sharing of encrypted IoT data. However, most of existing ABE schemes that bring tremendous computational cost are not suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. Therefore, lightweight and efficient data sharing and searching schemes suitable for IoT applications are of great importance. To this end, In this article, we propose a light searchable ABE scheme (namely LSABE). Our scheme can significantly reduce the computing cost of IoT devices with the provision of multiple-keyword searching for data users. Meanwhile, we extend the LSABE scheme to multiauthority scenarios so as to effectively generate and manage the public/secret keys in the distributed IoT environment. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our schemes can significantly maintain computational efficiency and save the computational cost at IoT devices, compared to other existing schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
1013	Deep Reinforcement Learning for Smart City Communication Networks	Smart city communication networks hold the promise of harnessing the Internet of Things, smart devices, intelligent energy grids, autonomous cars, and many other data architectures to improve quality of life for every citizen. As time and progress have gradually shifted this concept from an idea into a reality, the possibilities for what services a smart city might provide have exploded. Along with that expansion, the number of devices that may need to be supported across a communications network has multiplied enormously. However, existing congestion control protocols are not equipped to support this higher requirement for network performance. New protocols are needed to provide higher data throughputs, reduce queuing delays and packet loss, and maintain stable and reliable communications pathways. The end-to-end congestion control protocol presented in this article does all these things. Called high throughput congestion control (HTCC), the framework takes full advantage of reinforcement learning and a fast growth algorithm to adaptively control the bytes in flight across the network's links to suit the prevailing network conditions. The result is a protocol that not only finds the optimal tradeoff between throughput, latency, and packet loss, but also significantly speeds up the learning process to avoid wasting network resources, use all free bandwidth and maximize network utilization. A comprehensive set of experiments with HTCC and six state-of-the-art protocols - Copa, PCC Vivace, PCC-Allegro, TCP Cubic, TaoVA-100x, and FillP-Sheep - demonstrate that, in most conditions, HTCC is able to make the best tradeoff between throughput, delay, and loss rate. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1014	Privacy-Aware Data Fusion and Prediction with Spatial-Temporal Context for Smart City Industrial Environment	As one of the cyber-physical-social systems that plays a key role in people's daily activities, a smart city is producing a considerable amount of industrial data associated with transportation, healthcare, business, social activities, and so on. Effectively and efficiently fusing and mining such data from multiple sources can contribute much to the development and improvements of various smart city applications. However, the industrial data collected from the smart city are often sensitive and contain partial user privacy such as spatial-temporal context information. Therefore, it is becoming a necessity to secure user privacy hidden in the smart city data before these data are integrated together for further mining, analyses, and prediction. However, due to the inherent tradeoff between data privacy and data availability, it is often a challenging task to protect users' context privacy while guaranteeing accurate data analysis and prediction results after data fusion. Considering this challenge, a novel privacy-aware data fusion and prediction approach for the smart city industrial environment is put forward in this article, which is based on the classic locality-sensitive hashing technique. At last, our proposal is evaluated by a set of experiments based on a real-world dataset. Experimental results show better prediction performances of our approach compared to other competitive ones. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	125
1015	A Novel Method to Prevent Misconfigurations of Industrial Automation and Control Systems	Configuration errors are among the dominant causes of system faults for the industrial automation and control systems (IACS). It is difficult to detect and correct such errors of IACS as there are various kinds of systems and devices with miscellaneous configuration specifications. In this article, we first propose a streaming algorithm to keep all the configuration changes in the limited memory space. When making a new configuration change, another novel streaming algorithm is proposed to search and return all the similar historical changes, which can be used to validate this new one. So far, we are the first to model the configuration changes of IACS as a data stream and apply the streaming similarity search in correcting configuration errors while overcoming the inherent unbounded-memory bottleneck. The theoretical correctness and complexity analyses are presented. Experiments with real and synthetic datasets confirm the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in preventing misconfigurations of IACS. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1016	Energy Efficiency Optimization in SWIPT Enabled WSNs for Smart Agriculture	Smart agriculture is able to optimize the information resources of agriculture, which can improve the quality and productivity of agricultural products. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) provide smart agriculture with effective solutions for collecting, transmitting, and processing of information. However, the large number of sensor networks consume too much energy that violates the principle of green communication. Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technology utilizes radio-frequency signals to transmit information and provide energy to WSNs, which can extend the lifetime of WSNs effectively. In this article, an architecture design of smart agriculture is first proposed by exploiting the SWIPT. Then, an energy efficiency optimization scheme is studied to achieve green communication, in which the subcarriers' pairing and power allocation are jointly optimized. The process of communication is divided into two phases. Specifically, in the first phase, source sensor sends information to relay sensor and destination sensor. Relay sensor utilizes a part of the subcarriers to receive the information, and utilizes the remaining subcarriers to collect energy. Destination sensor uses all the subcarriers to receive the information. In the second phase, relay sensor utilizes the energy collected in the first phase to forward the information to destination sensor. An effective iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to resolve the proposed optimization problem through Lagrangian dual function. Simulation results validate that the performance of the algorithm can improve energy efficiency of the system effectively. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	33
1017	PigTalk: An AI-Based IoT Platform for Piglet Crushing Mitigation	On pig farms, many piglets die because they are crushed when sows roll from side to side or lie down. On average, 1.2 piglets are crushed by sows every day. To resolve the piglet mortality issue, this article proposes PigTalk, an artificial intelligence (AI) based Internet of Things (IoT) platform for detecting and mitigating piglet crushing. Through real-time analysis of the voice data collected in a farrowing house, PigTalk detects if any piglet screaming occurs, and automatically activates sow-alert actuators for emergency handling of the crushing event. We propose an audio clip transform approach to pre-process the raw voice data, and utilizes min-max scaling in machine learning (ML) to detect piglet screams. In our first contribution, the above data preprocessing method together with subtle parameter setups of the machine learning model improve the piglet scream detection accuracy up to 99.4%, which is better than the previous solutions (up to 92.8%). In our second contribution, we show how to design two cyber IoT devices, i.e., DataBank for data pre-processing and ML_device for real-time AI to automatically trigger actuators such as floor vibration and water drop to force a sow to stand up. We conduct analytic analysis and simulation to investigate how the detection delay affects the critical time period to save crushed piglets. Our study indicates that PigTalk can save piglets within 0.05 s with 99.93% of the successful rate. Such results are validated in a commercial farrowing house. PigTalk is a new approach that automatically mitigates piglet crushing, which could not be achieved in the past. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
1018	Efficient and Lightweight Data Streaming Authentication in Industrial Control and Automation Systems	The industrial control and automation systems have played an increasingly important role in critical manufacturing processes. In such systems, many Internet of Things devices continuously collect large number of streaming data for real-time processing. Verifiable data streaming (VDS) addresses such authenticity issue for streaming data, but most VDS schemes are not efficient and lightweight, do not support range querying, and cannot be used in practice. To improve the efficiency and achieve a verifiable range query in data streaming, we present here a new primitive, namely, a chameleon authentication tree with prefixes (PCAT), which is extended from the PBTree and chameleon authentication tree. Our scheme is not only lightweight but also supports dynamic expansion and verifiable range query in data streaming, making it more suitable for resource-constrained devices. We separate the PCAT's algorithms into the following phases: initialization, data appending, query, and verification. Our analyses prove that the PCAT satisfies all the security requirements of VDS. Moreover, an efficiency analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that our scheme not only supports lightweight data streaming authentication but also has high efficiency, which means that the PCAT is easier to apply in the industrial control and automation systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
1019	Secure Storage Auditing with Efficient Key Updates for Cognitive Industrial IoT Environment	Cognitive computing over big data brings more development opportunities for enterprises and organizations in industrial informatics, and can make better decisions for them when they face data security challenges. To satisfy the requirement of real-time data storage in industrial Internet of Things (IoT), the remote unconstrained storage cloud is usually used to store the generated big data. However, the characteristic of semitrust of the cloud service provider determines that the data owners will worry about whether the data stored in cloud computing has been corrupted. In this article, a secure storage auditing is proposed, which supports efficient key updates and can be well used in cognitive industrial IoT environment. Moreover, the proposed basic auditing can be extended to support batch auditing that is suitable for multiple end devices to audit their data blocks simultaneously in practice. In addition, a hybrid data dynamics method is proposed, which employs a hash table to store the data blocks and uses a linked list to locate the operated data block. Compared with previous methods, the data block location time in the proposed data dynamics can be reduced by 40%. The security analysis results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can be proved to be correct, and is secure under computational differ-hellman (CDH) and discrete logarithm (DL) assumptions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
1020	A Dynamical Simplified Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the Multiobjective Annual Crop Planning Problem Conserving Groundwater for Sustainability	In large-scale agriculture, insufficient irrigation water may lead to overpumping of groundwater, increasing the risk of land subsidence. Growing dryland crops can effectively decrease the demand for irrigation water. However, the previous works on annual crop planning (ACP) focused on maximizing the profit through growing wetland crops and consuming much water. For sustainability, in this article, we propose a mathematical programming model for an ACP that allocates a land area for growing dryland and wetland crops to maximize the total profit and minimize the total irrigation water used for multiple cropping, under practical constraints. The simplified swarm optimization (SSO) improves the particle swarm optimization with four probabilities to determine the operations of updating solutions. We further propose dynamic SSO (DSSO) to solve the concerned ACP in which the four probabilities are adjusted dynamically according to the performance of the operations executed. Through simulation on a case study, the proposed DSSO demonstrates high performance over some classical approaches. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

They impact the accuracy of data analysis and the objectivity of making decisions. However, how to identify attack behaviors from environmental interference and establish a secure route to transmit data for resource-constrained terminals are challenging problems. To address these problems, in this article, we propose a trust-based security system (TSS). In TSS, we first design a trust model using binomial distribution for calculating the node's trust value and a third-party recommendation scheme for improving the objectivity of trust value. Then, we propose a trust management scheme for preventing the on-off attack. After that, we design a secure routing protocol, which is used to balance the security, transmission performance, and energy efficiency. Finally, the analytical results of the TSS are evaluated with extensive simulation experiment. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21
1022	Efficient and Exact Multigraph Matching Search	A multigraph is modeled as a bag of graphs. Exact multigraph matching search aims to find all multigraphs that are the same as the query multigraphs from the data multigraph datasets. To the best of our knowledge, works regarding exact multigraph matching search have not been reported although they have a very wide range of application scenarios. In this article, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem of exact multigraph matching search. We first propose a definition of exact multigraph matching and its Basic Method (BM), called BM, which has a considerable amount of graph isomorphism detection calculations and, thus, has very high computational complexity. Obviously, it is impractical to compare the query multigraph to each data multigraph in the multigraph datasets. To reduce the search space, multiple filtering conditions are proposed to obtain a candidate result set containing all the final results, including the cardinality filter, the vertex filter, the edge filter, the size filter, and the star filter. Then, each multigraph in the candidate result set is verified with the Improved BM (IBM) algorithm. Moreover, an offline and Multilayer Inverted Index (MII), named MII, is proposed to further accelerate the search process. Finally, we propose an Exact Multigraph Matching Search (EMMS) algorithm, based on the abovementioned technologies. We also analyze its time complexity. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	
1023	Voice-Transfer Attacking on Industrial Voice Control Systems in 5G-Aided IIoT Domain	At present, specific voice control has gradually become an important means for 5G-Internet-of-Things-aided industrial control systems, such as controlling the operation and adjustment of industrial Internet of Things equipment through telephone voice of the controller. However, the security of specific voice control system needs to be improved, because the voice cloning technology based on transfer learning can easily simulate the voice of the controller, which may lead to industrial accidents and other potential security risks. Therefore, this article mainly aims to study and understand the principle of voice cloning attack technology, putting forward a voice clone attack method, in order to prepare for the construction of a specific voice recognition system in the future. At present, the key technology of voice cloning attack is how to solve the problem that the target speaker's personalized speech with high quality cannot be synthesized under small samples. In fact, voice cloning is a very challenging problem because speech is more difficult to be represented in the hidden space of the model. We propose a transductive voice transfer learning method to learn the predictive function from the source domain and fine-tune in the target domain adaptively. The target learning task and the source learning task are both synthesizing speech signals from the given audio, while the datasets of both domains are different. By adding different penalty values to each instances and minimizing the expected risk, an optimal precise model can be learned. In addition, an evaluation method to verify the audio similarity of the target speaker was given to show the similarity between the synthesized audio and the original audio. Many details of the experimental results show that our method can effectively synthesize the speech of the target speaker with small samples. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
1024	Towards Fish Individuality-Based Aquaculture	By bringing concepts of precision farming to intensive aquaculture fish production, it can be optimized to be more sustainable while focusing on fish welfare criteria. This requires a shift from mass to smart production and to consider each fish as an individual. Therefore, it is required to be able to identify each fish in a tank or sea cage. In this article, we prove the feasibility of fish identification using the iris as a biometric characteristic. Based on a new dataset, captured in a controlled out of water environment: 1) a fully automated iris recognition system is presented and utilized for the experiments and 2) the distinctiveness and the stability of the iris pattern of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is assessed. Results prove the distinctiveness, which indicates that the iris pattern of Atlantic salmon is suited for biometric identification. However, the iris pattern has a low stability, which means it changes over time. Due to frequent interaction of fish and system, usually multiple times a day during feeding, there is ample opportunity to keep the biometric template up-to-date, which makes the lack of long-term stability a nonissue. It can be concluded that a biometric fish identification system is feasible, with the precondition that biometric templates of each fish are periodically updated to combat the low stability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3

It is a challenge to develop individual diagnosis models to evaluate the nutrient status for a specific growth stage in time. Therefore, this article encoded spatiotemporal information of plants in a single time-series model to evaluate the nutrient status of oilseed rape more efficiently. Specifically, in this article, we combined the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to classify the oilseed rape crops according to their nutrient status. The model was validated on a large number of sequential images acquired from oilseed rape canopies at different growth stages during a two-year experiment. Different pretrained CNNs were used to extract distinctive features from every time step of sequential images and then, these features were considered as the input of LSTM to classify the oilseed rape into nine classes of nutrient statuses. We demonstrated that the LSTM outperformed the traditional machine-learning method and the deep features showed better performance compared with hand-crafted features. The Inceptionv3-LSTM obtained the highest overall classification accuracy of 95% when tested on the dataset of 2017/2018 and it also provided a good generalization when using a cross-dataset validation, with the highest overall accuracy of 92%. Our proposed approach presents a pathway toward automatic nutrient status diagnosis during the whole life cycle of the plants, and the LSTM technique would play an essential role in the near future for time-series analysis for precision agriculture. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	21

A promising approach for handling this problem is to introduce intelligent methods to implement a highly effective and efficient cellular traffic prediction model. Meanwhile, integrating the multiaccess edge computing framework in 5G cellular networks facilitates the application of intelligent traffic prediction models by enabling their implementation at the network edge. However, the data shortage and privacy issues may still be obstacles for training a robust and accurate prediction model at the edge. To address these issues, we propose a data-augmentation-based cellular traffic prediction model (ctGAN-S2S), where an effective data augmentation submodel based on generative adversarial networks is proposed to improve the prediction performance while protecting data privacy, and a long-short-term-memory-based sequence-to-sequence submodel is used to achieve the flexible multistep cellular traffic prediction.

Efficient control of canals is essential to improve water-diversion performance. Numerous model-based approaches have been proposed and made great progress for canal control. However, when the predictive model is unavailable or unpromising for long time step predictions, model-free approaches could be considered as a possible way to achieve efficient control. Since most existing model-free approaches are focused on control of small canals or reservoirs, this article proposes a new control approach named policy and action reinforcement learning (PARL) for large-scale canals. We leverage the idea of 'divide and conquer' to decompose the control task of large-scale canals into policy learning and action learning subtasks, and develop PARL by means of hierarchical reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments are conducted via numerical simulation on the case study of Chinese South to North Water Transfer Project, and experimental results show that PARL can achieve desirable performance improvements over other model-free learning approaches. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3

In this article, we propose MTGA, a Multitask Gated recurrent unit (GRU) Autoencoder, approach to 1) obtain the robust feature representation for the prediction task and 2) explore the time-ordered interactions among different stages of the grain chain. Specifically, we design multiple GRU encoder-decoder pairs to co-reconstruct the stage features in a common space for robust feature learning.

At present, many researchers have attempted to solve issues of illegal driver detection and legal driver identification by using deep learning network, but there are still quite a few limitations in the collection and analysis of driving behavior data. Moreover, the problem of driving behavior evaluation has been paid little attention. Therefore, in this article we conduct a comprehensive study on driving behavior habits and establish a multitask learning (MTL) network to solve the abovementioned problems. First, we collect original data from a real vehicle and extract the driving behavior characteristics. Then, a novel MTL network composed of long short-term memory network, support vector domain description model and feedforward neural network is established, which achieves illegal driver detection, legal driver identification, and driving behavior evaluation. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed MTL network not only supports parallel learning to reduce time and space costs, but also has excellent performances and robustness for the three tasks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1034	Digital Twinning Based Adaptive Development Environment for Automotive Cyber-Physical Systems	Automotive cyber-physical systems need to be rigorously checked and tested under various physical conditions. Automakers aim to improve development efficiency of the automotive cyber-physical systems in the fierce market competition. However, the actual development process suffers from the challenges of long development cycle and poor scalability. To tackle these challenges, this article develops a digital twinning based adaptive development environment for automotive cyber-physical systems, which addresses two critical problems: each physical entity (i.e., electronic control unit, component, test source, etc.) needs to clone a corresponding digital twin; digital twins and the physical entities need to interact closely. The first problem is addressed through proposing an integrated digital twinning clone flow. The second problem is addressed through developing a smart digital twinning board. Our case study with the automotive body control system demonstrates that the adaptive development environment achieves a high adaptability with short development cycle, low complexity, low cost, high scalability, and high flexibility, which meet various automotive cyber-physical design requirements during the development process. © 2021 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1035	Reliable Sensing Data Fusion Through Robust Multiview Prototype Learning	Due to emerging development of intelligent sensing technologies in Internet of Things, multisensor cooperation has been widely deployed in applications. Although multisensor information fusion can be addressed by multiview learning, its performance tends to degrade if any one sensor is disturbed with annoying noises by the environment or other factors. Therefore, fusing these cross-sensor data in a reliable and secure manner while removing those noises is crucial. Although there have been outlier-against multiview works proposed, most of them suffer from redundant parameters or performance degradation. Even worse, few of them have considered the complementary information across the sensors. In this article, we argue that in multiview information fusion, not only the clean data, but also those outliers share the same prototypes in a common space, except that the outliers are disturbed with noises. To this end, we propose a type of robust multiview prototype (RMVP) learning to fuse the sensing data while removing the noises automatically in the learning process. Specifically, in RMVP, projection matrices are designed for each sensing view to sketch the data prototypes. In addition, one auxiliary margin matrix is modeled for each sensing view to capture its data noises through penalizing a sparsity regularization on it. Afterwards, an alternating algorithm is presented to solve the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments on intelligent sensing data sets are conducted to testify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	
1036	Integrated Cyber and Physical Anomaly Location and Classification in Power Distribution Systems	Identifying the anomaly location and type (fault or attack) is of paramount importance for enhancing cyber-physical situational awareness, and taking informed and effective mitigation actions in power distribution systems with an increasing number of attack points in distributed and renewable energy sources. This article proposes the fault and attack location and classification (FALCON) system to classify and locate cyber and physical anomalies, including false data injection attacks on protection devices, replay attacks on communication networks, and physical faults on distribution lines. The proposed system takes as input the transient short-circuit current and voltage measured by protection relays, the relays command status as well as the fault alarm from fault indicators, which is fed into a deep neural network that classifies and identifies the location of the fault and attacks in the distribution system. Numerical studies demonstrate FALCON's capability to classify and locate multiple cyber and physical anomalies with more than 98% accuracy, even when multiple devices are simultaneously compromised. Furthermore, the impact of different sets of input data is explored to highlight the importance of fault indicators, fault voltage data, and data collected from the RES relays. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
1037	Forward Privacy Preservation in IoT-Enabled Healthcare Systems	In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled health monitoring wearable devices have become a trend in healthcare systems, regularly collecting vital sign data from patients and uploading them to the cloud. Through on-demand search queries, data are shared with third-party healthcare service providers to monitor patients' health status and provide timely diagnoses. To ensure privacy and security, patient health data should be encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud. The cloud can give search encryption services. However, current searchable encryption (SE) technologies still have problems with forward privacy security and verifiability. This article proposes an IoT-cloud-enabled healthcare data system incorporating a SE method with forward privacy and verifiability. By designing a trapdoor permutation function, we render the resulting output indistinguishable from meaningless random data to the adversary. Thus, the adversary cannot judge the relationship between a newly inserted record and a past search token, and therefore, the system realizes forward privacy or forward secrecy. We propose a multikeyword search verification mechanism based on a pseudo-random function. Our approach solves verifying the correctness of search results in the top-k search scenario with partial search results. A formal security analysis proves that our scheme achieves forward privacy preservation, which can help guarantee healthcare data privacy. Additionally, a performance evaluation shows that our method is efficient and effective, providing an information security system to preserve patient privacy in IoT-enabled healthcare systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
1038	Deep Reinforcement Learning Assisted Federated Learning Algorithm for Data Management of IIoT	The continuous expanded scale of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) leads to IIoT devices generating massive amounts of user data every moment. According to the different requirement of end users, these data usually have high heterogeneity and privacy, while most of users are reluctant to expose them to the public view. How to manage these time series data in an efficient and safe way in the field of IIoT is still an open issue, such that it has attracted extensive attention from academia and industry. As a new machine learning (ML) paradigm, federated learning (FL) has great advantages in training heterogeneous and privacy data. This paper studies the FL technology applications to manage IIoT equipment data in wireless network environments. In order to increase the model aggregation rate and reduce communication costs, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to IIoT device selection process, specifically to select those IIoT device nodes with accurate models. Therefore, we propose a FL algorithm assisted by DRL, which can take into account the privacy and efficiency of data training of IIoT equipment. By analyzing the data characteristics of IIoT equipments, we use MNIST, fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets to represent the data generated by IIoT. During the experiment, we employ the deep neural network (DNN) model to train the data, and the results show that the accuracy can reach more than 97%, which corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

1039	A Multistage Passive Islanding Detection Method for Synchronous-Based Distributed Generation	A multistage approach to passive islanding detection is proposed that utilizes a decision tree (DT) like classification algorithm. The novelty of the proposed method is centered on the way in which features are passed to subsequent stages of the DT. Feature sets extracted using different sized time windows are passed to successive stages of the tree. This provides two important advantages: 1) cases that can be easily determined as either islanding or nonislanding events are flagged as soon as possible without waiting for the full feature set to become available; 2) because the algorithm allows for the use of different sized time windows, features are analyzed in time-scales that fit their natural patterns of temporal evolution. In this article, the proposed classifier is trained and tested using a database of feature vectors, obtained using PSCAD, which were designed to reflect a variety of commonly encountered events on an IEEE 34-bus distribution system. One of the key requirements for the proposed algorithm was that easy cases should be flagged as soon as possible; this property was confirmed by the observation that most events (approx79%) were detected within 10-20 ms, while at the same time retaining a very high detection rate overall cases (> hzainaldin@masdar.ac.ae	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1040	Deep Reinforcement Learning for Stochastic Computation Offloading in Digital Twin Networks	The rapid development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires industrial production towards digitalization to improve network efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this article, we first propose a new paradigm digital twin network to build network topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem into a deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present asynchronous actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	39
1041	Demand Forecasting of the Fused Magnesia Smelting Process with System Identification and Deep Learning	The electricity demand of the fused magnesia smelting process (FMSP) is defined as the average electric power consumption over a fixed period of time, which is used to monitor the electricity cost in the FMSP. In this paper, we develop a dynamic model of the electricity demand based on the closedloop control system of the smelting current in the FMSP. The electricity demand prediction model combines an identifiable linear model with an unknown nonlinear dynamic system, which takes advantage of system identification. To predict the unknown nonlinear dynamic system, an adaptive deep learning prediction approach is proposed based on a multi-layer long short term memory (LSTM). The real data in the FMSP is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed electricity demand forecasting method. IEEE	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

In this challenging context, network heterogeneity also represents a critical element that can significantly limit the design and deployment of DT-oriented applications. This article proposes the Application-driven digital twin networking middleware with the twofold objective of: 1) Simplifying the interaction among heterogeneous devices by allowing DTs to exploit IP-based protocols instead of specialized industrial ones and to enhance packet content expressiveness, by enriching data via well-defined standards. 2) Dynamically managing network resources in edge industrial environments, applying software defined networking to exploit the communication mechanisms most suitable to application requirements, ranging from native IP to more articulated based on packet content. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
1043	A Sparse Nonstationary Trigonometric Gaussian Process Regression and its Application on Nitrogen Oxides Prediction of the Diesel Engine	Gaussian process regression has shown superiority in terms of state estimation for its nonparametric characteristic and uncertainty prediction ability. Due to its heavy computational complexity, Gaussian process regression is generally used for small datasets. To efficiently deal with the big data, the sparse spectrum approximation method has been successfully applied to GPR to decrease the computational complexity. However, the stationarity of this method is a strict assumption for data and usually mismatches the industrial processes. In this paper, we proposed a sparse nonstationary Gaussian process regression, which can deal with the nonstationary relationship among samples and make the model more flexible, to settle the above problems. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated using three public datasets and a sampled diesel engine dataset, and the results show the superiority of our proposed method in terms of accuracy.

1044	A Federated Learning-based License Plate Recognition Scheme for 5G-enabled Internet of Vehicles	License plate is an essential characteristic to identify vehicles for the traffic management, and thus license plate recognition is important for Internet of Vehicles. Since 5G has been widely covered, mobile devices are utilized to assist the traffic management, which is a significant part of Industry 4.0. However, there have always been privacy risks due to centralized training of models. Also, the trained model cannot be directly deployed on the mobile device due to its large number of parameters. In this paper, we propose a federated learning-based license plate recognition framework (FedLPR) to solve these problems. We design detection and recognition model to apply in the mobile device. In terms of user privacy, data in individuals is harnessed on their mobile devices instead of the server to train models based on federated learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedLPR has high accuracy and acceptable communication cost while preserving user privacy. IEEE	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18

1046	Integrated scheduling of real-time and interactive tasks for configurable industrial systems	With the recent advances in Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems technologies, smart industrial systems support configurable processes consisting of human interactions as well as hard real-time functions. This implies that irregularly arriving interactive tasks and traditional hard real-time tasks coexist. As the characteristics of the tasks are heterogeneous, it is not an easy matter to schedule them all at once. To cope with this situation, this article presents a new task scheduling policy that uses the notion of 'virtual real-time task' and two-phase scheduling. As hard real-time tasks must keep their deadlines, we perform offline scheduling based on genetic algorithms beforehand. This determines the processor's voltage level and memory location of each task and also reserves the virtual real-time tasks for interactive tasks. When interactive tasks arrive during the execution, online scheduling is performed on the time slot of the virtual real-time tasks. As interactive workloads evolve over time, we monitor them and periodically update the offline scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed policy reduces the energy consumption by 66.8% on average without deadline misses and also supports the waiting time of less than 3 (s) for interactive tasks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
1047	Designing Authenticated Key Management Scheme in 6G-Enabled Network in a Box Deployed for Industrial Applications	6G-enabled network in a box (NIB) is a multigenerational, rapidly deployable hardware, and software technology for the communication. 6G-enabled NIB provides high level of flexibility which makes it capable to provide connectivity services for different types of applications as it is effective for the communications of after disaster scenario, battlefields scenario, and industrial scenario.

Therefore, how to make full use of precious cases while not leaking out patients' privacy is a leading and promising work especially in future privacy-preserving intelligent medical period. In this article, we investigate how to securely invoke patients' records from past case-database while protecting the privacy of both current diagnosed patient and the case-database and construct a privacy-preserving medical record searching scheme based on ElGamal Blind Signature. In our scheme, by blinded the healthy data of the patient and the database of the iDoctor, respectively, the patient can securely make self-helped medical diagnosis by invoking past case-database and securely comparing the blinded abstracts of current data and previous records. Moreover, the patient can obtain target searching information intelligently at the same time he knows whether the abstracts match or not instead of obtaining it after matching. It greatly increases the timeliness of information acquisition and meets high-speed information sharing requirements, especially in 5G era. What's more, our proposed scheme achieves bilateral security, that is, whether the abstracts match or not, both of the privacy of the case-database and the private information of the current patient are well protected. Besides, it resists different levels of violent ergodic attacks by adjusting the number of zeros in a bit string according to different security requirements. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	55
1049	Cell Division Genetic Algorithm for Component Allocation Optimization in Multifunctional Placers	Optimizing all the objectives of the printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) optimization in a multifunctional placer remains a formidable challenge till now. This article converts the original PCBA optimization problem to a newly defined component allocation problem, which decides the component-type handled by each head per pickup-and-place (PAP) cycle. The component allocation problem is a quadratic 3-D assignment problem (Q3AP) and effectively combines the optimization of all the main objectives. It is possible that one head stays idle, so the assigning 2-D locations are uncertain. We propose the cell division genetic algorithm (CDGA) to solve such a complex Q3AP. The CDGA allocates a component cell as the basic unit. Each of the first-generation component cells contains the mounting points of the same type. A cell chromosome decoding heuristic is designed to determine the next assigning head. By doing so, the problem dimension is reduced, so the conventional GA can be used for searching the optimal component allocation formed by the current-generation cells. When a better allocation can no longer be found by allocating the current cells, the cell division operation is performed to divide each cell into two new cells. The new cells are used in the next round of GA searching, which further optimizes the allocation from two perspectives: better balancing the minimization of nozzle changes and PAP cycles, more flexibly maximizing the simultaneous pickups with the uncertain locations. The CDGA works continuously until the current cells cannot bring any improvement. In simulations and experiments using the industrial samples, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the PCBA time compared to two recent studies and the built-in optimizer of the widely used multifunctional placer, Hanwha SM482 PLUS, which demonstrates its effectiveness and superiority. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
1050	Automatic Fetal Ultrasound Standard Plane Recognition Based on Deep Learning and IIoT	Intelligent ultrasound imaging based on deep learning is one of the important applications in the field of intelligent medical care. In this article, we propose an automatic fetal ultrasound standard plane recognition (FUSPR) model based on deep learning in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment. We build a distributed ultrasound data processing and predicting platform by using the IIoT and high-performance computing (HPC) technology. The FUSPR model deployed in the HPC center consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) component and a recurrent neural network (RNN) component, which learns the spatial and temporal features of the ultrasound video stream by using multitask learning, respectively. The CNN component identifies fetal key anatomical structures from each video frame and accurately recognizes the potential four fetal standard planes. The RNN component obtains the temporal information between adjacent frames, and it realizes precise localization and tracking of fetal organs across frames. In addition, we introduce two feature fusion strategies into the FUSPR model, i.e., CNN fusion and RNN fusion, to fit the spatial sequence and motion representation in the video stream, thereby effectively improving the accuracy and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments conducted on more than 1000 ultrasound videos show that the FUSPR model is superior to the competing baselines in terms of accuracy and performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	41
1051	Improved Incremental RVFL with Compact Structure and Its Application in Quality Prediction of Blast Furnace	This paper proposes an improved incremental random vector functional-link network (RVFL) with compact structure and presents its application to quality prediction of blast furnace (BF) ironmaking processes. Different from the original RVFL, the improved incremental RVFL has no input-output direct links and no output bias (NLNB) and approaches the desired network output by sequentially updating the output weights of fixed hidden neurons. Moreover, it is proved that this improved incremental RVFL with NLNB (I-I-RVFL-NLNB) is able to approximate a given continuous function with arbitrary small errors with fewer hidden neurons. As a result, the developed network has more compact requiring and less execution time, while retaining the conventional incremental RVFL's advantage of monotonically decreasing errors and avoiding the overfitting issue of the basic RVFL-NLNB. Since the zero approximation error is not needed in practical applications, the terminal condition of the existing incremental RVFL is improved by using the difference of root mean squared error (RMSE) between two consecutive iterations as one of indices to characterize the imperceptible descending trend of RMSE. A series of comparisons are made by both benchmark simulations and a real quality modeling problem for a large BF ironmaking plant in South China, which show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in terms of modeling accuracy and efficiency.

1052	A Blockchain-Based Secure Data Aggregation Strategy Using Sixth Generation Enabled Network-in-Box for Industrial Applications	Sixth generation (6G) network is a revolutionary technology to satisfy the ever-growing demands from the sustainable development of emerging industrial applications and services. Due to its high flexibility, convenient and rapid deployment, self-organization capability, and outstanding expansibility, network-in-box (NIB) represents a promising approach for future networks. The integration of NIB with 6G can lead to many new applications in geoscience, robotics, and industrial automation. For 6G-enabled NIB, services are deployed directly on the NIB, which increases the fault tolerance and reduces the traffic volume on the backhaul link. As more and more data are processed and shared in industrial applications and services, the security of data aggregation becomes a key challenge for 6G-enabled NIB. To address this challenge, in this article, we propose a blockchain based privacy-aware distributed collection (BPDC) oriented strategy for data aggregation. In BPDC, an improved blockchain with a new block header structure and two different block generation rules are designed and introduced, which restricts the task receivers to search and receive the tasks beyond their levels of security permission. While guaranteeing the data aggregation performance, BPDC can also achieve privacy protection by decomposing sensitive tasks and task receivers into multiple groups. Validation experiments show that the BPDC accomplishes low overhead, high throughput, and privacy preservation in various industrial applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11

Since a huge diverse traffic would be generated by IIoT, the industrial processes would meet the challenges of spectrum scarcity and on-demand service requirements. Millimeter wave (mmW) and pervasive edge computing (PEC) technologies in 5G communication are available to deal with these requirements. In this article, a novel dual-band framework that integrates both mmW and microwave (μW) networks in PEC environment has been proposed, which locally performs joint resource allocation and power assignment over mmW and μW to meet IIoT devices' specific requirements. To consider the new prominent figure of merit in IIoT scenario, the scheduling problem is formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the IIoT energy consumption in real-time environment. A Lyapunov optimization technique has been applied for the objective function with low complexity and rapid convergence. To solve the NP-hard Lyapunov algorithm, we introduce a block coordinate descent method that decompose the Lyapunov problem into two nested subproblems over the mmW and μW networks. An initialization-free semidistributed scheme is proposed in mmW PECs, which not only requires little information exchange via the μW network but also achieves the global optimal solution.

In this article, we investigate the dynamic resource management problem of joint power control and computing resource allocation for MEC in IIoT. In order to minimize the long-term average delay of the tasks, the original problem is transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP). Considering the dynamics and continuity of task generation, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based dynamic resource management (DDRM) algorithm to solve the formulated MDP problem. Our DDRM algorithm exploits the deep deterministic policy gradient and can deal with the high-dimensional continuity of the action and state spaces.

Unfortunately, these data are highly vulnerable to various malicious attacks during its transit to the destination. Although the use of pervasive edge computing (PEC) with the Internet of Things (IoT) has solved various issues, such as latency, proximity, and real-time processing, but the security and authentication of data between the nodes is still a significant concern in PEC-based industrial-IoT scenarios. In this article, we present 'DWFCAT,' a dual watermarking framework for content authentication and tamper localization for industrial images. The robust and fragile watermarks along with overhead bits related to the cover image for tamper localization are embedded in different planes of the cover image. We have used discrete cosine transform coefficients and exploited their energy compaction property for robust watermark embedding. We make use of a four-point neighborhood to predict the value of a predefined pixel and use it for embedding the fragile watermark bits in the spatial domain. Chaotic and deoxyribonucleic acid encryption is used to encrypt the robust watermark before embedding to enhance its security. The results indicate that DWFCAT can withstand a range of hybrid signal processing and geometric attacks, such as Gaussian noise, salt and pepper, joint photographic experts group (JPEG) compression, rotation, low-pass filtering, resizing, cropping, sharpening, and histogram equalization. The experimental results prove that the DWFCAT is highly efficient compared with the various state-of-the-art approaches for authentication and tamper localization of industrial images. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

1061	Accuracy-Guaranteed Collaborative DNN Inference in Industrial IoT via Deep Reinforcement Learning	Collaboration among industrial Internet of Things (IoT) devices and edge networks is essential to support computation-intensive deep neural network (DNN) inference services, which require low delay and high accuracy. Sampling rate adaption, which dynamically configures the sampling rates of industrial IoT devices according to network conditions, is the key in minimizing the service delay. In this article, we investigate the collaborative DNN inference problem in industrial IoT networks. To capture the channel variation and task arrival randomness, we formulate the problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Specifically, sampling rate adaption, inference task offloading, and edge computing resource allocation are jointly considered to minimize the average service delay while guaranteeing the long-term accuracy requirements of different inference services. Since CMDP cannot be directly solved by general reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms due to the intractable long-term constraints, we first transform the CMDP into an MDP by leveraging the Lyapunov optimization technique. Then, a deep RL-based algorithm is proposed to solve the MDP. To expedite the training process, an optimization subroutine is embedded in the proposed algorithm to directly obtain the optimal edge computing resource allocation. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed RL-based algorithm can significantly reduce the average service delay while preserving long-term inference accuracy with a high probability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22
1062	Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Computation Offloading in Fog Enabled Industrial Internet of Things	Fog computing is seen as a key enabler to meet the stringent requirements of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Specifically, lower latency and IIoT devices' energy consumption can be achieved by offloading computation-intensive tasks to fog access points (F-APs). However, traditional computation offloading optimization methods often possess high complexity, making them inapplicable in practical IIoT. To overcome this issue, this article proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach to minimize long-term system energy consumption in a computation offloading scenario with multiple IIoT devices and multiple F-APs. The proposal features a multi-agent setting to deal with the curse of dimensionality of the action space by creating a DRL model for each IIoT device, which identifies its serving F-AP based on network and device states. After F-AP selection is finished, a low complexity greedy algorithm is executed at each F-AP under a computation capability constraint to determine which offloading requests are further forwarded to the cloud. By conducting offline training in the cloud and then making decisions online, iterative online optimization procedures are avoided and, hence, F-APs can quickly adjust F-AP selection for each device with trained DRL models. Via simulation, the impact of batch size on system performance is demonstrated and the proposed DRL-based approach shows competitive performance compared to various baselines including exhaustive search and genetic algorithm based approaches. In addition, the generalization capability of the proposal is verified as well. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
1063	Energy-Aware Marine Predators Algorithm for Task Scheduling in IoT-Based Fog Computing Applications	To improve the quality of service (QoS) needed by several applications areas, the Internet of Things (IoT) tasks are offloaded into the fog computing instead of the cloud. However, the availability of ongoing energy heads for fog computing servers is one of the constraints for IoT applications because transmitting the huge quantity of the data generated using IoT devices will produce network bandwidth overhead and slow down the responsive time of the statements analyzed. In this article, an energy-aware model basis on the marine predators algorithm (MPA) is proposed for tackling the task scheduling in fog computing (TSFC) to improve the QoSs required by users. In addition to the standard MPA, we proposed the other two versions. The first version is called modified MPA (MMPA), which will modify MPA to improve their exploitation capability by using the last updated positions instead of the last best one. The second one will improve MMPA by the ranking strategy based reinitialization and mutation toward the best, in addition to reinitializing, the half population randomly after a predefined number of iterations to get rid of local optima and mutated the last half toward the best-so-far solution. Accordingly, MPA is proposed to solve the continuous one, whereas the TSFC is considered a discrete one, so the normalization and scaling phase will be used to convert the standard MPA into a discrete one. The three versions are proposed with some other metaheuristic algorithms and genetic algorithms based on various performance metrics such as energy consumption, makespan, flow time, and carbon dioxide emission rate. The improved MMPA could outperform all the other algorithms and the other two versions. © 2020 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	56
1064	Blockchain Based IIoT Data Sharing Framework for SDN-Enabled Pervasive Edge Computing	Pervasive edge computing (PEC) is an emerging paradigm for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and software-defined networks (SDN) offer lower latency services, and massive intelligent devices connectivity for the IIoT. However, the PEC has some issues with data security, and privacy while PEC devices sharing data among edges. What's more, the centralized SDN suffers from single point of attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) from IIoT devices, and has the challenge of data leakage. In this article, we use blockchain, and proxy reencryption (PRE) technologies to tackle these challenges. The blockchain authorizes all devices in the network to improve their credibility, and authenticity. In addition, a blockchain-based data sharing framework that combines a PRE scheme is introduced for secure device-to-device communication in PEC environments. A series of smart contracts are designed for flexible operations of searching, and updating records on the blockchain.

1065	Low-Latency Federated Learning and Blockchain for Edge Association in Digital Twin Empowered 6G Networks	Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G) mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy, federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks. However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark learning methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	74
1066	A Reinforcement Learning Empowered Cooperative Control Approach for IIoT-Based Virtually Coupled Train Sets	Virtually coupled train sets (VCTS) have been proposed to increase the transportation capacity and the flexibility of railway organization. Due to the lack of reliable wireless communications and accurate perceptual information, the promotion of VCTS was challenged. With the development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an IIoT-based VCTS is built in the article based on the popular communication-based train control architecture. Considering the dynamic and complex operation environment, it is difficult to achieve the efficient cooperative control of VCTS. The reason is that the traditional method is frequently trapped into a local optimization. To resolve the problem, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to obtain an optimal policy for the IIoT-based VCTS, where the traditional artificial potential field (APF) is taken to develop the reward function. RL can thus search the global optimal policy, whereas APF can help RL to reduce the computation complexity. This can substantially increase the efficiency of the proposed approach. Simulation results confirmed that the proposed RL-based cooperative control approach would bring excellent performance in the IIoT-based VCTS. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1067	Reinforcement Learning Enabled Dynamic Resource Allocation in the Internet of Vehicles	As an important application scenario of the industrial Internet of things, the Internet of Vehicles can significantly improve road safety, improve traffic management efficiency, and improve people's travel experience. Due to the high dynamics of the Internet of vehicles environment, the traditional resource optimization technologies cannot meet the requirements of the Internet of vehicles for dynamic communication, computing and storage resources optimization management, and artificial intelligence algorithms can adaptively obtain dynamic resource allocation schemes through self-learning. Therefore, adopting artificial intelligence techniques to optimize the dynamic resource of the Internet of Vehicles is the research focus of this article. In this article, we first model the Internet of Vehicles resource allocation problem as a semi-Markov decision process that introduces a resource reservation strategy and a secondary resource allocation mechanism. Then, the reinforcement learning algorithm is used to solve the model. Thereafter, it theoretically analyzes the joint optimization of computing and communication resources, models it as a hierarchical architecture, and uses hierarchical reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal system resource allocation plan. Finally, the results of simulation experiments show that the dynamic resource allocation scheme of the Internet of vehicles based on the reinforcement learning in this article greatly improve resource utilization and user quality of experience with guaranteeing system quality of service compared with the traditional greedy algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
1068	Intelligent Signal Classification in Industrial Distributed Wireless Sensor Networks Based Industrial Internet of Things	In industrial sensor networks, complex industrial environments may be encountered leading to a mix of signals of different types. Complicated interference caused by mixed signals on industrial equipments may significantly degrade the classification rate of signals, which may result in a long training time in order to extract features. In addition, with limited channel resources, it is difficult to make the global optimal decision in industrial distributed wireless sensor networks. To address this problem, a signal classification method using feature fusion is proposed for industrial Internet of Things in this article. In the proposed method, the received signals of nodes are processed by frequency reduction and sampling pretreatment, based on which intelligent representations of signals are obtained. Using federated learning, the data samples are trained with the feature fusion network. Moreover, the trained deep learning network is used on each sensor node to classify signals, the results of which will be transmitted to aggregation center. In the aggregation center, the improved evidence theory method is used to aggregate the recognition results of each sensor node to achieve the final classification. Simulation shows that the proposed method has excellent classification performances. Notably, it is not required for the proposed method to transmit signals from nodes to the aggregation center, which could effectively protect the privacy of industrial information. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	34
1069	Industrial Pervasive Edge Computing-Based Intelligence IoT for Surveillance Saliency Detection	Numerous surveillance data processing is crucial in the Internet-of-Things systems with pervasive edge computing. In this process, salient object detection from surveillance videos plays an important role because it provides the human-concerned semantic cue for various industrial tasks. However, it is still challenging for the existing studies with two aspects. The first one is the redundant saliency information from moving background to disturb the detection of salient objects. The second one is the difficulty to model the spatiotemporal saliency uncertainty. To overcome these challenges. In this article, an intelligent approach is proposed for surveillance saliency detection. It enables a region-proposal-based optical flow strategy to suppress the saliency enhancement of non-salient regions due to the moving background. Besides, it develops the bidirectional Bayesian state transition strategy to model the motion uncertainty for refining the spatiotemporal saliency feature. Extensive experiments have been performed on two datasets (the increase of Fβ is larger than 0.01 for DAVIS, and larger than 0.015 for UVSD), and the comparison with seven methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16
1070	A Secured and Intelligent Communication Scheme for IIoT-enabled Pervasive Edge Computing	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) ensures reliable and efficient data exchanges among the industrial processes using artificial intelligence within the cyber-physical systems. In the IIoT ecosystem, devices of industrial applications communicate with each other with little human intervention. They need to act intelligently to safeguard the data confidentiality and devices' authenticity. The ability to gather, process, and store real-time data depends on the quality of data, network connectivity, and processing capabilities of these devices. Pervasive edge computing (PEC) is gaining popularity nowadays due to the resource limitations imposed on the sensor-embedded IIoT devices. PEC processes the gathered data at the network edge to reduce the response time for these devices. However, PEC faces numerous research challenges in terms of secured communication, network connectivity, and resource utilization of the edge servers. To address these challenges, we propose a secured and intelligent communication scheme for PEC in an IIoT-enabled infrastructure. In the proposed scheme, forged identities of adversaries, i.e., Sybil devices, are detected by IIoT devices and shared with edge servers to prevent upstream transmission of their malicious data. Upon Sybil attack detection, each edge server executes a parallel artificial bee colony (pABC) algorithm to perform optimal network configuration of IIoT devices. Each edge server performs the job migration to their neighboring servers for load balancing and better network performance, based on their processing and storage capabilities. The experimental results justify the efficiency of our proposed scheme in terms of Sybil attack detection, the convergence curves of our pABC algorithm, delay, throughput, and control overhead of data communication using PEC for IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23

High dependence on the cloud/fog computation, availability of the network, and expert knowledge make it handicap in the rural off-network areas. Use of edge devices, such as smartphones, attributed by computation capabilities is the solution that is yet to be developed at commercial level (Fawwaz and Chung 2020) and (Zhengwei et al., 2021). Additionally, the user's growing demand for economic and user-friendly technology motivates to shift from costly and complex sensors to economic. In this article, we present the hybridized computational intelligence methodology to develop an edge-device-enabled AI technology for health monitoring and diagnosis (HM&D) of the off-road vehicles, taking use of super economic microphones as sensors. Smartphones are benefited by integrated microphones, and thus, the App-based developed technology is generalized for all vehicles from old to new. Enhanced selection and log-scaled mutation genetic algorithms is used to evolve the structure of the artificial neural network toward an optimally lightweight structure. Each evolved lightweight ANN structure is trained by scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation training algorithm to optimize corresponding weights and biases.

Therefore, reasonable arrangement for intelligent distribution of FAP in smart cities can effectively guarantee product quality, improve distribution efficiency, reduce distribution cost, and increase customer satisfaction. In actual distribution in smart city, road conditions are one of the important factors that affect the distribution. Therefore, according to the influence of road conditions on refrigerated vehicle’s (RV’s) speed, the RV’s speed characteristic models are established. Meanwhile, according to the characteristics of FAP, the penalty cost function based on the time window is constructed. According to the idea of fuzzy logic, the customer satisfaction evaluation model is established. Then, in order to minimize the distribution costs and maximize customer satisfaction as the optimization goal of intelligent distribution in smart city, the mathematical model is built. For solving this model, an improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm (IQPSO) is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of IQPSO is verified by simulation.

1076	Resource Allocation for Latency-aware Federated Learning in Industrial Internet-of-Things	Federated Learning (FL) has been employed for tremendous privacy-sensitive applications, where distributed devices collaboratively train a global model. In Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) systems, training latency is the key performance metric as the automated manufacture usually requires timely processing. The existing works increase the number of effective devices to accelerate the training.

Data in AIoT	Under the needs of processing huge amounts of data, providing high-quality service, and protecting user privacy in artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), federated learning (FL) has been treated as a promising technique to facilitate distributed learning with privacy protection. Although the importance of developing privacy-preserving FL has attracted a lot of attentions, the existing research only focuses on FL with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) data and lacks study of non-i.i.d. scenario. What is worse, the assumption of i.i.d. data is impractical, reducing the performance of privacy protection in real applications. In this article, we carry out an innovative exploration of privacy protection in FL with non-i.i.d. data.

Based on our analysis, a novel algorithm, 2DP-FL, is designed to achieve differential privacy by adding noise during training local models and when distributing global model. Especially, our 2DP-FL algorithm has a flexibility of noise addition to meet various needs and has a convergence upper bound. Finally, the real-data experiments can validate the results of our the oretical analysis and the advantages of 2DP-FL in privacy protection, learning convergence, and model accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15

1080	Adaptive Configuration of Service-Based Smart Sensors in Edge Networks	Edge computing promises to facilitate the collaboration of smart sensors at the network edge, in order to satisfy the delay constraints of certain requests, and decrease the transmission of large-volume sensory data from the edge to the cloud. Generally, the functionalities provided by smart sensors are encapsulated as services, and the satisfaction of certain requests is reduced to the composition of services configured upon smart sensors in edge networks. Considering the dynamics and nonpredictability of incoming requests, an adaptive and online service configuration mechanism is essential, especially when various temporal constraints are prescribed by requests and satisfied by configured services. In this article, we formulate this problem in terms of a continuous-time Markov decision process model based on the state-action-reward mechanism. A temporal-difference learning approach is developed to optimize the service configuration while taking long-term delay sensitivity and energy efficiency into consideration.

In this article, an innovative differential privacy (DP) compliant algorithm is developed to ensure that the data from consumer's smart meters are protected. The effects of this novel algorithm on the operation of the distribution grid are thoroughly investigated not only from a consumer's electricity bill point of view but also from a power systems point of view. This method allows for an empirical investigation into the losses, power quality issues, and extra costs that such a privacy-preserving mechanism may introduce to the system. In addition, severalcost allocation mechanisms based on the cooperative game theory are used to ensure that the extra costs are divided among the participants in a fair, efficient, and equitable manner. Overall, the comprehensive results show that the approach provides privacy preservation in line with the consumer's preferences and does not lead to significant cost or loss increases for the energy retailer.

1082	Optimal Dynamic Recharge Scheduling for Two-Stage Wireless Power Transfer	Many industrial-Internet-of-Things applications require autonomous operation and incorporate devices in inaccessible locations. Recent advances in wireless power transfer (WPT) and autonomous vehicle technologies, in combination, have the potential to solve a number of residual problems concerning the maintenance of, and data collection from embedded devices. Equipping inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and embedded devices with subsystems to facilitate WPT allows a UAV to become a viable mobile power delivery vehicle (PDV) and data collection agent. A key challenge is, therefore, to ensure that a PDV can optimally schedule power delivery across the network, such that it is as reliable and resource efficient as possible. To achieve this and out-perform naive on-demand recharging strategies, in this article, we propose a two-stage wireless power network (WPN) approach in which a large network of devices may be grouped into small clusters, where packets of energy inductively delivered to each cluster by the PDV are acoustically distributed to devices within the cluster. In this article, we describe a novel dynamic recharge scheduling algorithm that combines genetic weighted clustering with nearest neighbor search to jointly minimize PDV travel distance and WPT losses.

1084	A Reinforcement Learning-Empowered Feedback Control System for Industrial Internet of Things	The rapid development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables IIoT devices to offload their computation-intensive tasks to nearby edges via wireless base stations and thus relieve their resource constraints. To better guarantee quality-of-service, it has become necessary to cooperate multiple edges instead of letting them work alone. However, the existing solutions commonly use a centralized decision-making manner and cannot effectively achieve good load balancing among massive edges that are widely distributed in IIoT environments. This results in long decision-making time and high communication costs. To address this important problem, in this article, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-empowered feedback control method for cooperative load balancing (RF-CLB). First, by integrating RL and machine learning (ML) algorithms, each edge independently schedules tasks and performs load balancing between adjacent edges based on the local information. Next, through feedback control and multiedge cooperation, the objective multiedge load-balancing plan for IIoT can be found. Simulation results demonstrate that the RF-CLB chooses the adjustment operations of load balancing with 96.3% correctness. Moreover, the RF-CLB achieves the near-optimal performance, which outperforms the classic ML-based and rule-based methods by 6-9% and 10-12%, respectively. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
1085	A TOPSIS-Based Relocalization Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks	Selecting reliable beacon nodes plays a significant role in relocalizing unknown nodes in a wireless sensor network. When the position of a beacon node is drifted or is spoofed, it becomes an unreliable beacon node, which would lead to a large relocalization deviation of unknown nodes in its neighbor. However, when selecting reliable beacon nodes, most relocalization algorithms only screen either drifting beacon nodes or malicious beacon nodes whose position is drifted or spoofed. This article proposes an algorithm that can simultaneously screen drifting beacon nodes and malicious beacon nodes. The algorithm is divided into four steps. First, three indicators are introduced, where two are for describing position drifting and one is for describing position spoofing. Second, the entropy method is used to weight the contributions of three indicators. Third, a technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution is used to construct a reliability evaluation model. Finally, using the reliability evaluation model select reliable beacon nodes. Experimental results illustrate that the detection accuracy of drifting beacon nodes and malicious beacon nodes of the proposed algorithm is 7.5% and 8.2% higher than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1086	DNNOff: Offloading DNN-Based Intelligent IoT Applications in Mobile Edge Computing	A deep neural network (DNN) has become increasingly popular in industrial Internet of Things scenarios. Due to high demands on computational capability, it is hard for DNN-based applications to directly run on intelligent end devices with limited resources. Computation offloading technology offers a feasible solution by offloading some computation-intensive tasks to the cloud or edges. Supporting such capability is not easy due to two aspects: Adaptability: offloading should dynamically occur among computation nodes. Effectiveness: it needs to be determined which parts are worth offloading. This article proposes a novel approach, called DNNOff. For a given DNN-based application, DNNOff first rewrites the source code to implement a special program structure supporting on-demand offloading and, at runtime, automatically determines the offloading scheme. We evaluated DNNOff on a real-world intelligent application, with three DNN models. Our results show that, compared with other approaches, DNNOff saves response time by 12.4-66.6% on average. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	32

To improve this situation, a novel two-stage unsupervised fault recognition algorithm, namely, deep adaptive fuzzy clustering algorithm (DAFC) is proposed for unsupervised fault clustering in this article. DAFC amalgamates stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) into adaptive weighted Gath–Geva (AWGG) clustering to form an unsupervised fault recognition framework for clustering analysis of unlabeled industrial big data. SSAE can extract the highly abstract features of the original data, and adopt different unsupervised strategies to fine-tune the network in two stages. AWGG is an improvement of Gath–Geva clustering, and can adaptively obtain optimal clustering results without presetting the number of clusters. Experimental results on two different datasets show that the proposed DAFC can stably extract fault features from unlabeled data, and automatically obtain the optimal clustering results without knowing the number of clusters in advance. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first attempt to fine-tune SSAE in an unsupervised manner, and to propose an unsupervised fault recognition framework that requires no prior knowledge or data labels at all. DAFC can be a feasible industrial big data application for collaborative AIoT. Diagnostic personnel analyze the clustering results obtained by DAFC instead of the original unlabeled data, greatly saving time and labor costs. © 2021 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1088	Privacy-Preserving Aggregation for Federated Learning-Based Navigation in Vehicular Fog	Federated learning-based automotive navigation has recently received considerable attention, as it can potentially address the issue of weak global positioning system (GPS) signals under severe blockages, such as in downtowns and tunnels. Specifically, the data-driven navigation framework combines the position estimation offered by the high-sampling inertial measurement units (IMUs) and the position calibration provided by the low-sampling GPS signals. Despite its promise, the privacy preservation and flexibility of the participating users in the federated learning process are still problematic. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient, flexible, and privacy-preserving model aggregation scheme under a federated learning-based navigation framework named FedLoc. Specifically, our proposed scheme efficiently protects the locally trained model updates, flexibly supports the fluctuation of participants, and is robust against unregistered malicious users by exploiting a homomorphic threshold cryptosystem, together with the bounded Laplace mechanism and the skip list. We perform a detailed security analysis to demonstrate the security properties in terms of privacy preservation and dishonest user detection. In addition, we evaluate and compare the computational efficiency with two traditional schemes, and the simulation results show that our scheme greatly improves the computational efficiency during participant fluctuation. To validate the effectiveness of our scheme, we also show that only part of the model update is excluded from aggregation in the case of a dishonest user.

In this article, we exploit nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for computation offloading in MA-MEC and propose a joint optimization of the multiaccess multitask computation offloading, NOMA transmission, and computation-resource allocation, with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of IoT device to complete its tasks subject to the required latency limit. We first focus on a static channel scenario and propose a distributed algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem by identifying the layered structure of the formulated nonconvex problem. Furthermore, we consider a dynamic channel scenario in which the channel power gains from the IoT device to the edge-computing servers are time varying. To tackle with the difficulty due to the huge number of different channel realizations in the dynamic scenario, we propose an online algorithm, which is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to efficiently learn the near-optimal offloading solutions for the time-varying channel realizations. Numerical results are provided to validate our distributed algorithm for the static channel scenario and the DRL-based online algorithm for the dynamic channel scenario. We also demonstrate the advantage of the NOMA assisted multitask MA-MEC against conventional orthogonal multiple access scheme under both static and dynamic channels. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	43

In the proposed configuration, MMMGs can be connected to the coastal distribution grids in both normal and post-disaster operations. It is assumed that both MMMGs and SCUC networks include both dispatchable (e.g., gas turbines and diesel generators) and nondispatchable generators (e.g., photovoltaics and wind turbines). The proposed problem consists of realistic formulations that seek to minimize the total MMMGs and SCUC operation costs, while maximizing distribution grid resiliency. A heuristic technique, known as the collective decision optimization algorithm, is employed to address the complexity and nonlinearity of the formulated problem.

1093	Energy-Efficient End-to-End Security for Software-Defined Vehicular Networks	One of the most promising application areas of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). VANETs are largely used by intelligent transportation systems to provide smart and safe road transport. To reduce the network burden, software-defined networks (SDNs) act as a remote controller. Motivated by the need for greener IIoT solutions, this article proposes an energy-efficient end-to-end security solution for software-defined vehicular networks (SDVNs). Besides, SDN's flexible network management, network performance, and energy-efficient end-to-end security scheme plays a significant role in providing green IIoT services. Thus, the proposed SDVN provides lightweight end-to-end security. The end-to-end security objective is handled in two levels: 1) in roadside unit (RSU)-based group authentication scheme, each vehicle in the RSU range receives a group ID-key pair for secure communication; and 2) in private collaborative intrusion detection system (p-CIDS), the SDVN detects the potential intrusions inside the VANET architecture using collaborative learning that guarantees privacy through a fusion of differential privacy and homomorphic encryption schemes. The SDVN is simulated in NS2 and MATLAB, and results show increased energy efficiency with lower communication and storage overhead than existing frameworks. In addition, the p-CIDS detects the intruder with an accuracy of 96.81% in the SDVN. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	22

1096	Softwarized Industrial Deterministic Networking Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	Guaranteeing network transmission is one of the most challenging issues in industrial informatization. In the industrial sites without proper networking infrastructure, by deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), transmission-oriented cyber-physical system (CPS) is an excellent candidate to exploit to provide transmission. In this article, we focus on establishing deterministic network transmission (DNT) using UAV-based CPS, complying with the principles in time sensitive network/deterministic networking in industrial internet. The software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is adopted for UAVs-based CPS to achieve global optimization. First, we build the coordinate-based global topology view in the SDN controller to manage and control UAVs by integrating UAVs into the view and applying the network positioning method. Then, we introduce a hop-limited time synchronization approach to improve accuracy by reducing synchronization deviation. Last, based on the view, a geometric multipath generating method is proposed to enhance reliability by reducing the joint degree of multiple paths and facilitating convergence. The extensive simulation experiments show that our proposed UAV-CPS allows DNT to provide better reliability with reduced latency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics

However, withstanding cyber threats to such large-scale, complex, and heterogeneous industrial CPSs has been extremely challenging, due to the insufficiency of high-quality attack examples. In this article, we propose a novel federated deep learning scheme, named DeepFed, to detect cyber threats against industrial CPSs. Specifically, we first design a new deep learning-based intrusion detection model for industrial CPSs, by making use of a convolutional neural network and a gated recurrent unit. Second, we develop a federated learning framework, allowing multiple industrial CPSs to collectively build a comprehensive intrusion detection model in a privacy-preserving way. Further, a Paillier cryptosystem-based secure communication protocol is crafted to preserve the security and privacy of model parameters through the training process.

Noticing that DTs may bring estimation deviations from the actual value of device state, a trusted-based aggregation is proposed in federated learning to alleviate the effects of such deviation. We adaptively adjust the aggregation frequency of federated learning based on Lyapunov dynamic deficit queue and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to improve the learning performance under the resource constraints. To further adapt to the heterogeneity of industrial IoT, a clustering-based asynchronous federated learning framework is proposed.

1099	Deep Federated Q-Learning-Based Network Slicing for Industrial IoT	Fifth generation and beyond networks are envisioned to support multi industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications with a diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Network slicing is recognized as a flagship technology that enables IIoT networks with multiservices and resource requirements by allowing the network-as-infrastructure transition to the network-as-service. Motivated by the increasing IIoT computational capacity, and taking into consideration the QoS satisfaction and private data sharing challenges, federated reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising approach that distributes data acquisition and computation tasks over distributed network agents, exploiting local computation capacities and agent's self-learning experiences. This article proposes a novel deep RL scheme to provide a federated and dynamic network management and resource allocation for differentiated QoS services in future IIoT networks. This involves IIoT slices resource allocation in terms of transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) according to the slices QoS requirements. Toward this goal, the proposed deep federated Q-learning (DFQL) is reached into two main steps. First, we propose a multiagent deep Q-learning-based dynamic slices TP and SF adjustment process that aims at maximizing self-QoS requirements in term of throughput and delay. Second, the deep federated learning is proposed to learn multiagent self-model and enable them to find an optimal action decision on the TP and the SF that satisfy IIoT virtual network slice QoS reward, exploiting the shared experiences between agents. Simulation results show that the proposed DFQL framework achieves efficient performance compared to the traditional approaches. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	25
1100	Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems-Based Cloud IoT Edge for Federated Heterogeneous Distillation	Deep convoloutional networks have been widely deployed in modern cyber-physical systems performing different visual classification tasks. As the fog and edge devices have different computing capacity and perform different subtasks, models trained for one device may not be deployable on another. Knowledge distillation technique can effectively compress well trained convolutional neural networks into light-weight models suitable to different devices. However, due to privacy issue and transmission cost, manually annotated data for training the deep learning models are usually gradually collected and archived in different sites. Simply training a model on powerful cloud servers and compressing them for particular edge devices failed to use the distributed data stored at different sites. This offline training approach is also inefficient to deal with new data collected from the edge devices. To overcome these obstacles, in this article, we propose the heterogeneous brain storming (HBS) method for object recognition tasks in real-world Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Our method enables flexible bidirectional federated learning of heterogeneous models trained on distributed datasets with a new 'brain storming' mechanism and optimizable temperature parameters. In our comparison experiments, this HBS method outperformed multiple state-of-the-art single-model compression methods, as well as the newest multinetwork knowledge distillation methods with both homogeneous and heterogeneous classifiers. The ablation experiment results proved that the trainable temperature parameter into the conventional knowledge distillation loss can effectively ease the learning process of student networks in different methods. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first IoT-oriented method that allows asynchronous bidirectional heterogeneous knowledge distillation in deep networks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	19

It provides stable and reliable connectivity from the data center to distributed user terminals and the IIoT. However, traditional massive MIMO suffers from high power consumption and fabrication cost. The design of energy-efficient massive MIMO technology is essential for larger scale industrial deployments. In this article, we design three types of nonlinear RF chain structures, which not only reduce the power consumption of massive MIMO systems but also save fabrication costs. Information theoretic analysis demonstrates the power efficiency performance of our nonlinear system design. Our nonlinear MIMO system designs can increase the power efficiency by up to 2.3 times compared with the traditional MIMO system. We have demonstrated that our systems can achieve the same uplink rate as traditional MIMO by increasing the number of receiving antennas but with less overall power consumption. We also proposed an algorithm to overcome the problem of low computational efficiency due to high-dimensional integration when calculating the uplink achievable rate of nonlinear MIMO. Moreover, we reveal that when the skew-normal distribution is used as signaling, the nonlinear MIMO systems can achieve better performance than the Gaussian distribution. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	45
1102	Age-of-Information Aware Scheduling for Edge-Assisted Industrial Wireless Networks	Industrial wireless networks (IWNs) have attracted significant attention for providing time-critical delivery services, which can benefit from device-to-device (D2D) communication for low transmission delay. In this article, a distributed scheduling problem is investigated for D2D-enabled IWNs, where D2D links have various age-of-information (AoI) constraints for information freshness. This problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to optimize D2D packet delivery over limited spectrum resources, which is intractable since D2D users have no prior knowledge of the operating environment. To tackle this problem, in this article, an AoI-aware scheduling scheme is proposed based on primal-dual optimization and actor - critic reinforcement learning. In specific, multiple local actors for D2D devices learn AoI-aware scheduling policies to make on-site decisions with their stochastic AoI constraints addressed in the dual domain. An edge-based critic estimates the performance of all actors' decision-making policies from a global view, which can effectively address the nonstationary environment caused by concurrent learning of multiple local actors.

In CCPS, cloud storage applies data deduplication techniques aiming to save data storage and bandwidth for real-time services. In this infrastructure, data deduplication eliminates duplicate data to increase the performance of the CCPS application. However, it incurs security threats and privacy risks. For example, the encryption from independent users with different keys is not compatible with data deduplication. In this area, several types of research have been done. Nevertheless, they are suffering from a lack of security, high performance, and applicability. Motivated by this, in this article, we propose a message lock encryption with neVer-decrypt homomorphic encRyption (LEVER) protocol between the uploading CCPS user and cloud storage to reconcile the encryption and data deduplication. Interestingly, LEVER is the first brute-force resilient encrypted deduplication with only cryptographic two-party interactions.

However, due to the hierarchy and heterogeneity in IIoT, it is very challenging to perform content placement with lower energy consumption. In this article, we propose an energy-efficient content placement strategy in cache-enabled hierarchical IIoT network with coded transmission. We derive a closed-form expression including the energy consumption for content placement and transmission by the macro base station and the small base stations. In addition, we establish an optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption, whereby we find the optimal content placement matrix and optimal cache size allocation, respectively.

However, additional spectrum sensing and long-time working may consume much energy of CIIoT. In this article, a CIIoT with wireless energy harvesting (WEH) is proposed to harvest the radio frequency energy of PU's signal, and energy-efficient resource allocations in different spectrum access modes are presented to maximize the average transmission rate of CIIoT while guaranteeing its energy saving requirements. The underlay and overlay spectrum access modes for CIIoT with WEH are described, respectively, in which the energy-efficient resource allocations are formulated as joint optimization problems that can be solved using the alternating direction optimization and water-filling algorithm. By combining underlay and overlay modes, a hybrid spectrum access mode is proposed to enable the CIIoT to access both idle and busy spectrum without limiting its transmission power at the absence of PU.

A feedback convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, including three repeated segments of convolution, pooling, and flattening, is designed in this article for multiple extraction of spectral features from one-dimensional NIR data. An error-feedback iteration mechanism is proposed in the model training process to optimize convolution filters of each segment. Multisegment features are fused successively to ease the sparse information issue. Fusion data are further used to train the calibration models with a parametric-scaling fully connected network to determine the suitable numbers of hidden and output nodes. The adaptive network structure has the advantage of obtaining optimal prediction results from fused feature data. The proposed feedback CNN architecture based on feature information fusion is applied to the NIR rapid quantitative detection of selenium content in paddy rice samples. Experimental results showed that the fusion of multisegment features can enhance the ability of spectral information extraction. The optimal model based on fused feature data performs better than models based on separate feature data of each segment.

Blockchain-based access control method has become a promising security technology, but it still faces high latency in consensus process and weak adaptability to dynamic changes in network environment. This article proposes a novel access control framework for 5G-enabled IIoT based on consortium blockchain. We design three types of chaincodes for the framework named policy management chaincode (PMC), access control chaincode (ACC), and credit evaluation chaincode (CEC). The PMC and ACC are deployed on the same data channel to implement the management of access control policies and the authorization of access. The CEC deployed on another channel is used to add behavior records collected from IIoT devices and calculate the credit value of IIoT domain. Specifically, we design a two-step credit-based Raft consensus mechanism, which can select the orderer nodes dynamically to achieve fast and reliable consensus based on historical behavior records stored in the ledger. Furthermore, we implement the proposed framework on a real-world testbed and compare it with the framework based on practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus. The experiment results show that our proposed framework can maintain lower consensus cost time with 100 ms level and achieves four to five times throughput with lower hardware resource consumption and communication consumption. Besides, our design also improves the security and robustness of the access control process. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10

1113	Multiple Strategies Differential Privacy on Sparse Tensor Factorization for Network Traffic Analysis in 5G	Due to high capacity and fast transmission speed, 5G plays a key role in modern electronic infrastructure. Meanwhile, sparse tensor factorization (STF) is a useful tool for dimension reduction to analyze high-order, high-dimension, and sparse tensor (HOHDST) data, which is transmitted on 5G Internet-of-things (IoT). Hence, HOHDST data relies on STF to obtain complete data and discover rules for real time and accurate analysis. From another view of computation and data security, the current STF solution seeks to improve the computational efficiency but neglects privacy security of the IoT data, e.g., data analysis for network traffic monitor system. To overcome these problems, this article proposes a multiple-strategies differential privacy framework on STF (MDPSTF) for HOHDST network traffic data analysis. MDPSTF comprises three differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, i.e., varepsilon - DP, concentrated DP, and local DP. Furthermore, the theoretical proof of privacy bound is presented. Hence, MDPSTF can provide general data protection for HOHDST network traffic data with high-security promise. We conduct experiments on two real network traffic datasets (Abilene and Ggrave{E}ANT). The experimental results show that MDPSTF has high universality on the various degrees of privacy protection demands and high recovery accuracy for the HOHDST network traffic data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	34

1115	Two-Level Soft RAN Slicing for Customized Services in 5G-and-Beyond Wireless Communications	In this article, a two-level soft-slicing scheme is proposed for 5G-and-beyond radio access networks to support ultrareliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services with delay/reliability and throughput requirements, respectively. At the network level, we first determine the number of radio resources required for eMBB services and analyze the delay violation probability for URLLC services. Then, an integer nonlinear program is formulated for the network-level resource preallocation. Since the formulated problem is NP-complete, a low-complexity heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain near-optimal solutions. Given the preallocated resources at each gNodeB (gNB), a gNB-level resource scheduling scheme is designed to enable real-time resource sharing among URLLC services considering the reliability and delay requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed soft-slicing scheme meets stringent quality-of-service requirements for both URLLC and eMBB services and achieves high resource utilization efficiency when compared with conventional hard resource slicing schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1116	Automated Satellite-Based Assessment of Hurricane Impacts on Roadways	During extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, trees can cause significant challenges for the local communities with roadway closures or power outages. Local responders must act quickly with information regarding the extent and severity of hurricane damage to better manage recovery procedures following natural disasters. This article proposes an approach to automatically identify fallen trees on roadways using high-resolution satellite imagery before and after a hurricane. The approach detects fallen trees on roadways via a covoting strategy of three different algorithms and tailored dissimilarity scores. The proposed method does not rely on the large manually labeled satellite image data, making it more practical than existing approaches. Our solution has been implemented and validated on an actual roadway closure dataset from Hurricane Michael in Tallahassee, Florida, in October 2018. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1117	Digital Twin-Assisted Real-Time Traffic Data Prediction Method for 5G-Enabled Internet of Vehicles	The development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has produced a considerable amount of real-Time traffic data. These traffic data constitute a kind of digital twin that connects the physical vehicles and their virtual representation via 5G communications. Generally, through analyzing the digital twin traffic data, traffic administrators can optimize traffic scheduling and alleviate traffic jams. However, the exceptions of IoV sensors inevitably raise an issue of traffic data sparsity and consequently influence scientific traffic scheduling decisions. Inspired by this drawback, in this article, a digital twin-Assisted real-Time traffic data prediction method is proposed by analyzing the traffic flow and velocity data monitored by IoV sensors and transmitted through 5G. At last, we conduct a set of experiments based on a traffic dataset collected by Nanjing city of China.

1118	Intelligent Security Performance Prediction for IoT-Enabled Healthcare Networks Using an Improved CNN	The global healthcare industry and artificial intelligence have promoted the development of the diversified intelligent healthcare applications. Internet of Things (IoT) will play an important role in meeting the high throughput requirements of diversified intelligent healthcare applications. However, the mobile IoT-enabled healthcare networks are diverse and open, the healthcare big data transmission is vulnerable to a potential attack, which can cause network outages and serious healthcare security issues. To process the complex healthcare security event in real time, security performance prediction is critical for mobile IoT-enabled healthcare networks. In this article, we first analyze the security performance, and derive the novel expressions for the security performance in a closed form. Then, to analyze the security performance in real time, a security performance intelligent prediction algorithm is proposed. An improved convolutional neural network (CNN) model is designed, which combines the four-layer convolution and a four-branch inception block, and can adopt different convolution kernels in the same layer. The four-branch inception block can increase the width of the CNN while reducing the parameters. The improved CNN model can not only increases the width of the CNN, extract different sizes of healthcare data features, but also increases the adaptability to the nonlinear healthcare big data. Compared with different methods, the proposed intelligent algorithm can obtain better security performance prediction.

1119	CSIE-M: Compressive Sensing Image Enhancement Using Multiple Reconstructed Signals for Internet of Things Surveillance Systems	Artificial intelligence of things has brought artificial intelligence to the cutting-edge Internet of Things. In recent years, compressive sensing (CS), which relies on sparsity, is widely embedded and expected to bring more energy efficiency and a longer battery lifetime to IoT devices. Different from the other image compression standards, CS can get various reconstructed images by applying different reconstruction algorithms on coded data. Using this property, it is the first time to propose a deep learning based compressive sensing image enhancement framework using multiple reconstructed signals (CSIE-M). In this article, first, images are reconstructed by different CS reconstruction algorithms. Second, reconstructed images are assessed and sorted by a no-reference quality assessment module before being input to the quality enhancement module by order of quality scores. Finally, a multiple-input recurrent dense residual network is designed for exploiting and enriching the useful information from the reconstructed images. Experimental results show that CSIE-M obtains 1.88–8.07 dB peek-signal-to-noise (PSNR) improvement while the state-of-the-art works achieve a 1.69–6.69 dB PSNR improvement under sampling rates from 0.125 to 0.75. On the other hand, using multiple reconstructed versions of the signal can improve 0.19–0.23 dB PSNR, and only 4% reconstructing time is increasing compared to using a reconstructed signal. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society.

1120	Resilient Operation of Distribution Grids Using Deep Reinforcement Learning	This article utilizes deep reinforcement learning to develop an intelligent resilience controller (IRC) that devises fast real-time operation decisions to strategically dispatch distributed generation and energy storage units for restoring power to customers after sudden outages. The proposed IRC learns the failure development pattern of uncertain high-impact events and is able to explore a large action space in the partially observable state space of distribution grids under widespread outages. A spatiotemporal hurricane impact analysis model is presented as an example of uncertain high-impact events, and its parameters are used in training the IRC model and preparing it for similar events. In the proposed model, the distribution grid operation under uncertainty is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and actions taken by the operator are rewarded based on operation costs. Since the number of distributed energy resources can be significant, the scalability issue of the method is addressed by reformulating the problem as a sequential MDP. The proposed model is implemented on a test distribution grid undergoing a hurricane, and its performance is compared with common operation strategies, indicating the superiority of the proposed model in terms of reduced operation cost and close to zero running time. Further analysis shows the adaptability of the proposed model to hurricanes of various intensities. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1121	A Sentiment Classification Method of Web Social Media Based on Multidimensional and Multilevel Modeling	Sentiment classification of web social media faces the problem of text context semantics missing. The existing research mainly solves the problem of text context semantic missing by mining language symbol information in web social media text, seldom considering the emoticon symbols and punctuation symbols in web social media text. Similar to language symbols, emoticons’ symbols and punctuation symbols in web social media text also contain certain sentiment information. In order to make full use of sentiment information contained in web social media to solve the problem of text context semantics missing, we propose a sentiment classification method of web social media based on multidimensional and multilevel modeling. By modeling web social media text from three dimensions (language symbols, emoticons’ symbols, and punctuation symbols) and three levels (words, sentences, and documents) based on a deep learning framework, in this article, we attempt to solve text context semantics missing faced by the sentiment classification of web social media and improve the accuracy of sentiment classification of web social media. The experimental results on Sina Weibo and Twitter datasets show that the average accuracy of our method is 0.9479, which achieves more than 5.86% performance compared with the existing sentiment classification methods. © 2021 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6

How to accurately measure the flow parameters in the gas-liquid two-phase flow remains a challenging problem. In this article, we develop a novel deep learning based soft measure technique to predict the gas void fraction, which is one key parameter in a gas-liquid two-phase flow. We conduct the vertical upward gas-liquid two-phase flow experiments to measure the flow signals by using the four-sector distributed conductance sensor. Then, we design a novel multitask-based temporal-channelwise convolutional neural network (MTCCNN) to predict the gas void fraction. In MTCCNN, we first utilize the decomposed convolutional block to extract temporal dependence and channel connection from fluid data. After further fusion by the dense layer, we apply multitask learning to make full use of the extracted features through both classification branch and gas void fraction prediction branch. We compare our MTCCNN with its variations to demonstrate the proposed improvements. We also present other competitive methods for comparisons, which shows that our MTCCNN presents a better performance in gas void fraction prediction. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1123	A Blockchain-Based Machine Learning Framework for Edge Services in IIoT	Edge services provide an effective and superior means of real-time transmissions and rapid processing of information in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the continuous increase of the number of smart devices results in privacy leakage and insufficient model accuracy of edge services. To tackle these challenges, in this article, we propose a blockchain-based machine learning framework for edge services (BML-ES) in IIoT. Specifically, we construct novel smart contracts to encourage multiparty participation of edge services to improve the efficiency of data processing. Moreover, we propose an aggregation strategy to verify and aggregate model parameters to ensure the accuracy of decision tree models. Finally, based on the SM2 public key cryptosystem, we protect data security and prevent data privacy leakage in edge services. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments indicate that the BML-ES framework is secure, effective, and efficient, and is better suitable to improve the accuracy of edge services in IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	24
1124	A Checkpoint Enabled Scalable Blockchain Architecture for Industrial Internet of Things	Industry 4.0 represents the fourth industrial revolution that will leverage the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to introduce adaptive and autonomous systems that can self-heal and self-learn. IIoT aims to promote businesses and industries by realizing intelligent industrialization. However, the constantly surging data volumes that are generated by IIoT environments present security issues like data integrity and system scalability. Blockchain is a promising candidate to address these problems, which offers distributed system design principles. Though blockchain-based IIoT frameworks may have the potential to support the demands and services of next-generation industrial systems, their integration is still constrained by significant challenges in scalability and security. Therefore, blockchain in its original structure with traditional proof-of-work consensus is not suitable for IIoT. To address this, we propose a blockchain architecture that uses a dynamic proof-of-work consensus with a block checkpoint mechanism. The dynamic consensus functions with different mining difficulty levels allow the architecture to efficiently scale with increase in communication traffic of IIoT devices, whereas the checkpoint defines an alternative mechanism to generate the next block hash in the blockchain. To study the scalability and feasibility of the architecture, thorough performance and security analyses are presented, which attest that it can scale and offer enhanced security fidelity with a minimal increase in block mining time. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1125	An Intelligent Signal Processing Data Denoising Method for Control Systems Protection in the Industrial Internet of Things	The development of the industrial Internet of Things paradigm brings forth the possibility of a significant transformation within the manufacturing industry. This paradigm is based on sensing large amounts of data, so that it can be employed by intelligent control systems (i.e., artificial intelligence algorithms) eliciting optimal decisions in real time. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the intelligent wireless sensing and control system pipeline is crucial toward achieving this goal. Nevertheless, the presence of noise in actual wireless transmission processes considerably affects the quality of the sensed data. Typically, noise and anomalies present in the data are very difficult to distinguish from each other. Conventional anomaly-detection techniques generate many error reports, which cause the control systems to issue incorrect responses that hinder the industrial production. In this article, a novel solution is proposed to denoise data while simultaneously preserving the actual anomalies. The proposed approach operates by measuring both the neighbor and background contrasts in computing a noise score. The trust level of each data point is then calculated through a correlation measure to purge spurious data. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach yields effective performance, as compared to existing methods, and it meets the requirements of low latency-facilitating the normal operation of the monitored control systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3

Cybertwin emerges as a promising solution along with next-generation communication networks, i.e., 6G technology; however, it increases additional challenges at the edge networks. Motivated by the aforementioned perspectives, in this article, we introduce a new cybertwin-driven edge framework using 6G-enabled technology with an intelligent service provisioning strategy for supporting a massive scale of IoE applications. The proposed strategy distributes the incoming tasks from IoE applications using the deep reinforcement learning technique based on their dynamic service requirements. Besides that, an artificial-intelligence-driven technique, i.e., the support vector machine (SVM) classifier model, is applied at the edge network to analyze the data and achieve high accuracy. The simulation results over the real-time financial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed service provisioning strategy and the SVM model over the baseline algorithms in terms of various performance metrics. The proposed strategy reduces the energy consumption by 15% over the baseline algorithms, while increasing the prediction accuracy by 12% over the classification models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6

Among the important enabling technologies, federated learning, industrial edge computing, and Byzantine-tolerant machine learning (ML) are key accelerators in Industry 5.0. We propose a framework to integrate these key components. Recent works have designed various Byzantine-tolerant ML algorithms for a datacenter or a cluster. However, these algorithms are difficult to be applied to industrial edge computing paradigms. In this article, a novel Byzantine-tolerant federated learning algorithm, CRACAU, is designed for the popular three-level edge computing architecture. In this algorithm, edge devices jointly learn an ML model using the data collected at each device, and their private data are never shared with others. Under standard assumptions, we formally prove that CRACAU converges to the optimal point, i.e., CRACAU finds the optimal parameters of the ML model. We also implement CRACAU in the MXNet framework and evaluate it on the popular benchmark MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification datasets. Experimental results show that CRACAU achieves satisfying accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1128	Resource and Trajectory Optimization for Secure Communications in Dual Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mobile Edge Computing Systems	With the maneuverability and mobility control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), carrying mobile edge computing (MEC) servers on UAVs is able to effectively alleviate the explosive growth of data traffic pressure. However, UAV adopts line-of-sight transmission which has broadcasting characteristics. Malicious eavesdroppers can easily take advantage of the characteristics to eavesdrop information during the UAV edge computing. Therefore, the security of the UAV-MEC systems is a challenging problem. This article proposes a secure communication scheme for the dual-UAV-MEC system. In the proposed scheme, UAV server assists ground users in calculating the offloading tasks. In order to reduce the eavesdropping of offloading information by UAV eavesdropper, jammer sends interference signals on the ground. We aim to maximize the user's minimum secure calculation capacity by optimizing resources and trajectory of the UAV server. We first transform the optimization problem into a tractable form through mathematical methods and use successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent algorithms to solve it in an iterative manner. The final numerical results show that, compared with the benchmark schemes, the method proposed in this article effectively increases the secure calculation capacity of the system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
1129	Quality-Related Root Cause Diagnosis Based on Orthogonal Kernel Principal Component Regression and Transfer Entropy	This article is devoted to solving the problem of quality-related root cause diagnosis for nonlinear process. First, an orthogonal kernel principal component regression model is constructed to achieve orthogonal decomposition of feature space, such that quality-related and quality-unrelated faults can be separately detected in the subspaces of opposite correlations to the output, without any effect on each other. Then, in view of the high complexity of traditional nonlinear fault diagnosis methods, an efficient method of kernel sample equivalence replacement is established to replace the partial differential operations of the kernel gradient algorithm, which can convert nonlinear fault detection indicators into the standard quadratic forms of the original variable sample, thereby making it possible to solve the nonlinear fault diagnosis problem by linear manners. Furthermore, a transfer entropy algorithm is utilized to the new model to analyze the causality between the diagnosed candidate faulty variables to find out the accurate root cause of the fault. Finally, comparative studies between the latest result and the proposed one are carried out in the Tennessee Eastman process to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the new method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	16

1131	Deep-IFS: Intrusion Detection Approach for Industrial Internet of Things Traffic in Fog Environment	The extensive propagation of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies has encouraged intruders to initiate a variety of attacks that need to be identified to maintain the security of end-user data and the safety of services offered by service providers. Deep learning (DL), especially recurrent approaches, has been applied successfully to the analysis of IIoT forensics but their key challenge of recurrent DL models is that they struggle with long traffic sequences and cannot be parallelized. Multihead attention (MHA) tried to address this shortfall but failed to capture the local representation of IIoT traffic sequences. In this article, we propose a forensics-based DL model (called Deep-IFS) to identify intrusions in IIoT traffic. The model learns local representations using local gated recurrent unit (LocalGRU), and introduces an MHA layer to capture and learn global representation (i.e., long-range dependencies). A residual connection between layers is designed to prevent information loss. Another challenge facing the current IIoT forensics frameworks is their limited scalability, limiting performance in handling Big IIoT traffic data produced by IIoT devices. This challenge is addressed by deploying and training the proposed Deep-IFS in a fog computing environment. The intrusion identification becomes scalable by distributing the computation and the IIoT traffic data across worker fog nodes for training the model. The master fog node is responsible for sharing training parameters and aggregating worker node output. The aggregated classification output is subsequently passed to the cloud platform for mitigating attacks. Empirical results on the Bot-IIoT dataset demonstrate that the developed distributed Deep-IFS can effectively handle Big IIoT traffic data compared with the present centralized DL-based forensics techniques. Further, the results validate the robustness of the proposed Deep-IFS across various evaluation measures. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
1132	FDA3: Federated Defense against Adversarial Attacks for Cloud-Based IIoT Applications	Along with the proliferation of artificial intelligence and Internet of things (IoT) techniques, various kinds of adversarial attacks are increasingly emerging to fool deep neural networks (DNNs) used by industrial IoT (IIoT) applications. Due to biased training data or vulnerable underlying models, imperceptible modifications on inputs made by adversarial attacks may result in devastating consequences. Although existing methods are promising in defending such malicious attacks, most of them can only deal with limited existing attack types, which makes the deployment of large-scale IIoT devices a great challenge. To address this problem, in this article, we present an effective federated defense approach named $\text{FDA}^3$ that can aggregate defense knowledge against adversarial examples from different sources. Inspired by federated learning, our proposed cloud-based architecture enables the sharing of defense capabilities against different attacks among IIoT devices. Comprehensive experimental results show that the generated DNNs by our approach can not only resist more malicious attacks than existing attack-specific adversarial training methods, but also prevent IIoT applications from new attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14

1135	Dependable Scheduling for Real-Time Workflows on Cyber-Physical Cloud Systems	Cyber-physical cloud systems (CPCS) are integrations of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and cloud computing infrastructures. Integrating CPS into cloud computing infrastructures could improve the performance in many aspects. However, new reliability and security challenges are also introduced. This fact highlights the need to develop novel methodologies to tackle these challenges in CPCS. To this end, this article is oriented toward enhancing the soft-error reliability of real-time workflows on CPCS while satisfying the lifetime reliability, security, and real-time constraints. In this article, we propose a dependable algorithm for scheduling workflow applications on CPCS. The proposed algorithm uses slack to recover failed tasks and allows all tasks to share the available slack in the system. To improve soft-error reliability, the algorithm first determines the priority of tasks, then assigns the maximum frequency to each task, and finally assigns the recoveries to tasks dynamically. Slack also can be used to utilize security services for satisfying system security requirements. The lifetime reliability constraint is met by dynamically scaling down the operating frequency of low-priority tasks. Extensive experiments on real-world workflow benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the probability of failure by up to $52.1\%$ and improves the scheduling feasibility by up to $83.5\%$ compared to a number of representative approaches. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42

Therefore, the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of rolling bearing is greatly indispensable. To accurately predict the RUL of the rolling bearing, a new kind of gated recurrent unit neural network with dual attention gates, namely, gated dual attention unit (GDAU), is proposed.

Next, the to-be HI sequence is predicted by GDAU according to the existing HI vector, and then the RUL of the rolling bearing is estimated. The experimental results show that the proposed GDAU can effectively predict the RULs of rolling bearings, and it has higher prediction accuracy and convergence speed than the conventional prediction methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	58

These networks allow a two-way flow of energy-trading between electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (CSs) in the SG. EVs are regarded as one of the most effective tools to reduce energy demands. It will bring a great impact on our society and human life. Thus, during energy trading between EVs and CSs, various security, and privacy challenges occur in V2G networks. Although several proposals have been proposed, still there are many issues like lack of integrity, mutual authentication, and identity privacy-preservation make the system more vulnerable. Researchers have used the centralized system in V2G networks which may act as a single point of failure. So, for deploying secure V2G networks in the SG, we propose an energy-trading scheme having blockchain between three communicating parties, i.e., EVs, CSs, utility center.

1142	Man-in-the-Middle Attack Mitigation in Internet of Medical Things	The Internet of Medical Things are susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, which can identify healthcare emergency of monitored patients and replay normal physiological data to prevent the system from raising an alarm. In this article, we propose a framework to prevent a MitM from disrupting the operations and prohibiting the raise of alarms by the remote healthcare monitoring system. To reduce energy consumption for normal data transmission, and preserve the privacy of health data, our framework transmits a smaller size signature derived from acquired data with message authentication code, where the key is derived from received signal strength indication.

1143	A Dynamic-State-Estimator-Based Tolerance Control Method Against Cyberattack and Erroneous Measured Data for Power Systems	Cyberattacks against measured variables and faulty metering devices are among the most important threats to modern systems that should be detected and isolated, and the control actions based on the measured variables should be appropriate in order to keep the power system security. This article proposes a dynamic-state-estimation-based cyberattack-tolerant control method for modern power systems. The proposed method involves two new schemes: one is for dynamically detecting the cyberattack and the other isolates the location of the attack. These schemes are based on dynamic observer designs that can eliminate the effects of unknown inputs. This article also proposes a fault-tolerant control technique using these observer-based detection and isolation schemes. The proposed method can accurately track dynamic states, detecting both cyberattack against measured variables and faulty measuring devices, and isolating the cyberattack and fault locations. The results verify its superiority in comparison with other techniques. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1144	EduChain: CIA-Compliant Blockchain for Intelligent Cyber Defense of Microservices in Education Industry 4.0	Massive data handling requirement in education Industry 4.0 has attracted interests in the research of microservice architectures due to their scalability, resilience, and elasticity characteristics. This development has been challenged by extensive data exchange required by a set of independent microservices to build a complete application, which could result in increasing risks and exposure to the security and privacy breaches of the data. It is imperative to see that educational data are highly sensitive, critical for ascertaining educational attainment and facilitating credentials for qualification verifications. This article puts forward a new proposal of devising a security and privacy-preserving design mechanism of data transactions in educational microservices leveraging the blockchain technology. The design comprises three phases, namely the blockchain framework, data sending-receiving, and confidentiality-integrity-availability over a secured platform with each phase having detailed mechanisms for algorithm implementation. The proposal is shown to exhibit favorable performance in terms of time cost of publishing, throughput, and latency, and shown to have high survey acceptance in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability with approximately 10% improvement from prior blockchain adoption. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1145	On-Demand Sensing and Wireless Power Transfer for Self-Sustainable Industrial Internet of Things Networks	On-demand data sensing and wireless power transfer (WPT) can provide sustainability and robust operations in large-scale industrial Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The efficiency of on-demand data collection and WPT can be increased by efficient scheduling of IoT nodes and dedicated energy transmitters respectively. In this article, we propose an energy-aware mode switching strategy to enable IoT nodes to perform either on-demand sensing or dedicated WPT. For on-demand sensing, we propose an IoT node scheduling scheme to maximize the utility of the IoT nodes comprising residual energy and energy required for sensing operation while considering the reliability of sensing tasks. For WPT, we propose an energy transmitter scheduling scheme for IoT nodes to minimize the cost of charging while keeping IoT nodes sufficiently charged. The simulation results for IoT node scheduling demonstrate that less than 50% IoT nodes need to be activated in all scenarios to complete the tasks. The proposed energy transmitter scheduling scheme shows that less than 60% energy transmitters should be scheduled in all the scenarios which results in significant energy reduction in the overall system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
1146	SpoVis: Decision Support System for Site Selection of Sports Facilities in Digital Twinning Cities	The site selection of sports facilities is a pivotal link in the construction of city livable environment and the development of sports business in digital-twinning cities. Recent years have witnessed data mining and visualization technologies bringing the convenience as well as opportunities for intelligent site selection. However, the lack of effective and reliable systematic analysis leads to difficulties in developing sports facilities planning schemes and constructing the site-selection system. In this article, we design Sport facility Visual analysis system (SpoVis), an interactive visual analysis system for planning sports facilities as well as site selection. SpoVis provides users with the distribution status and statistical analysis of various sports facilities. Based on a comprehensive consideration of city population distribution, construction cost, existing sports facilities, traffic situation, and development potential, SpoVis provides users with a reasonable site-selection scheme of sports facilities from both macro and microperspectives and recommends results through topology and map. Meanwhile, based on the distribution of existing sports facilities and city influencing factors, a set of visual analysis components are designed to facilitate users to evaluate the status and information of existing sports facilities. We have carried out extensive experiments on a real platform with real-world data.

1147	Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Based Heterogeneous Graph Embedding Method for Trigger-Action Programming in IoT	Nowadays, users can personalize Internet of Things (IoT) devices/web services via trigger-action programming (TAP). As the number of connected entities grows, the relations of triggers and actions become progressively complex (i.e., the heterogeneity of TAP), which becomes a challenge for existing models to completely preserve the heterogeneous data and semantic information in trigger and action. To address this issue, in this article, we propose IoT nonnegative matrix factorization (IoT-NMF), a NMF-based heterogeneous graph embedding method for TAP. Prior to using IoT-NMF, we map triggers and actions to an IoT heterogeneous information network, from which we can extract three structures that preserve heterogeneous relations in triggers and actions. IoT-NMF can factorize the structures simultaneously for getting low-dimensional representation vectors of the triggers and actions, which can be further utilized in Artificial Intelligence of Things applications (e.g., TAP rule recommendation). Finally, we demonstrate the proposed approach using an if this then that (IFTTT) dataset. The result shows that IoT-NMF outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2021 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1148	Hybrid Intelligence Assisted Sample Average Approximation Method for Chance Constrained Dynamic Optimization	Realistic industrial process is usually a dynamic process with uncertainty. Chance constraints are applicable to industrial process modeling under uncertain conditions, where constraints cannot be strictly met, or need not be fully met. Therefore, chance constrained dynamic optimization (CCDO) formulation is available to address realistic industrial process issues. Because of the dynamic and uncertainty, chance constrained dynamic optimization problems (CCDOPs) arising from practical industries are hard to cope with. In this article, a novel CCDO method is proposed to resolve this issue, where an adaptive sample average approximation method, a control vector parameterization method, and a state constraint handling strategy are integrated. Specially, a hybrid intelligent optimization algorithm is introduced to realize a global and efficient optimization performance. The proposed method is applied to CCDOPs modified by dynamic optimization standard test functions and industrial experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Then, a stacked autoencoder model is used to construct health indicators from the selected features. In the improved NSGA-II algorithm, the optimization goals of feature selection are defined as the minimum gap of health indicators between different states and the number of features. Comparisons between the proposed method and the state-of-the-art methods on simulation experiments show that the proposed method can accurately identify the status of the equipment and effectively limit the complexity of the diagnostic model. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8
1150	A Novel Feature-Extraction-Based Process Monitoring Method for Multimode Processes with Common Features and Its Applications to a Rolling Process	In this article, a novel feature-extraction-based process monitoring method is proposed for multimode processes with common features. Different from the traditional feature extraction methods that consider either common scores or common weightings between different modes, a common-subspace-based method that takes both common scores and weightings into account is developed based on tensor decomposition. In addition, specific features for each mode are extracted by the independent component analysis. Moreover, a moving-window Kullback-Leibler-divergence-based detection statistic is developed to monitor the changes in both common and specific features. The newly proposed methods are applied to a real hot rolling mill (HRM) process, where common setting for different steel slabs and specific configurations for each steel product exist. The practical application performance shows that the proposed methods can accurately capture common features and effectively monitor different fault cases in an HRM process. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1151	A Data-Driven Approach of Product Quality Prediction for Complex Production Systems	In the modern industry, the information has been sufficiently shared among the production equipment, intelligent subsystems, and mobile devices via advanced network technology. For this purpose, many challenges on plant-wide performance evaluation such as product quality prediction have been received considerable attention in complex industrial Internet of Things systems. In this article, an efficient and effective soft sensor based on the semisupervised parallel deepFM model is proposed for the product quality prediction. First, a label broadcasting method is presented to augment labeled samples from unlabeled samples. Then, a data binning method is introduced to discretize process variables for an unbiased estimation. Based on the modified deepFM model, quality information can be separately extracted from different components of the model while high- and low-dimensional features can be obtained. Manifold regularization is embedded into the back propagation algorithm, in which unlabeled samples issue can be further resolved. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42
1152	Real-Time Implementation of Plug-and-Play Process Monitoring and Control on an Experimental Three-Tank System	Three-tank system is an important benchmark in industrial process. However, so far, the research on the three-tank system is mainly limited to simulation studies, and the use of virtual simulators. In this article, a real-time three-tank system setup is used for practical investigations. Differing with the virtual simulator of a three-tank system, the setup can enable the setting of different types of faults (such as cloggings and leaks in the system, sensor faults, and actuator faults) through manual manipulation, users can choose the combinations of different valves and knobs in the setup, which is helpful to evaluate and compare methods for process monitoring and control. The relevant codes or modules can be applied directly that are developed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. On this setup, two methods are used to verify the effectiveness in this study. One method is to solve the problem of process monitoring and fault detection; due to the fluctuation of the liquid level caused by flow, the input/output (I/O) data are preferred to be decomposed to different subspaces, which aims to identify the data-driven stable kernel representation. Moreover, the original controller of the three-tank system cannot match the system accurately, and therefore, needs to be modified. To solve the problem, a plug-and-play process control method (the other method used in this article) is applied, which adds a stable Youla parameterization matrix on the basis of the original controller. All controllers that internally stabilize the control loop improves the performance of the system without changing the original controller of the three-tank system. The experimental results of the two methods indicate that the proposed approach has strong practicality. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1153	A Nonconvex Archetypal Analysis for One-Class Classification Based Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems	Data-driven anomaly detection is one of the central issues for the implementation of predictive maintenance in cyber-physical systems (CPS). The increasing nonstationary dynamics in CPS lead to complex shapes of collected process data, e.g., convex and nonconvex. Algorithms with the ability of handling nonconvex data are desired for anomaly detection tasks in CPS. Archetypal analysis selects extreme points (archetypes) to represent a dataset - mainly to improve run times, e.g., for anomaly detection. The classic archetypal analysis uses convex combinations of archetypes to represent a set of observations (data points). This leads to the performance depression of the classic archetypal analysis methods for anomaly detection tasks on nonconvex datasets. Such nonconvex sets are typical for CPS. In this article, the anomaly detection tasks are considered as one-class classification problem due to the lack of abnormal samples. A novel nonconvex archetypal one-class classification algorithm is proposed to address the challenge of nonconvex data, which combines the random projection and the AdaBoost algorithm. The major advantages of this method are its high efficiency, flexibility, and its ability to handle both convex and nonconvex datasets, i.e., it can be applied to CPS analysis tasks. The usefulness of the presented approach is evaluated for fault diagnosis tasks in CPS. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1154	Industrial Big Data Modeling and Monitoring Framework for Plant-Wide Processes	This article proposes a distributed parallel modeling and monitoring framework for plant-wide processes with big data.

The other represents the distributed parallel modeling for big process data with various features. Under the framework, the distributed parallel mixture probabilistic latent variable model is proposed based on the stochastic variational inference algorithm and the parameter server architecture to cope with the big process data. Then, the model is utilized to develop the plant-wide hierarchical and distributed process monitoring algorithms, where the multilevel monitoring indexes and fault contribution indexes are established based on the Bayesian fusion algorithm for process fault detection and diagnosis. The performance comparison and visualization for the industrial plant-wide process case has demonstrated the reliability and superiority of the proposed algorithm and framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
1155	Double-Layer Distributed Monitoring Based on Sequential Correlation Information for Large-Scale Industrial Processes in Dynamic and Static States	Due to the complex static, dynamic, and large-scale characteristics for modern industrial processes, in this article, we propose a double-layer distributed monitoring approach based on multiblock slow feature analysis and multiblock independent component analysis. To this end, the processed dataset is divided into the static and dynamic blocks on the basis of the sequential information of each variable in the first layer. Considering the correlations between the variables in the large-scale processes, the sequential correlation matrices in two blocks are calculated, which serves as the second-layer block division rule. Then, the static and dynamic blocks are further divided into several static and dynamic subblocks in which the variables in each subblock are strongly correlated and in the same state. The slow feature analysis and independent component analysis monitoring models are, respectively, generated for the dynamic and static subblocks. Finally, the monitoring results in each subblock are integrated by Bayesian inference to get the final statistics. The average fault detection rate of the proposed method for the Tennessee Eastman process is 0.842, while those of the other traditional methods are lower than 0.75, which shows the advantages of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	20
1156	Multisubspace Orthogonal Canonical Correlation Analysis for Quality-Related Plant-Wide Process Monitoring	Plant-wide processes often have the characteristics of large-scale and multiple operating units. Moreover, due to the closed-loop control, it is possible that the fault never affects product quality. In this article, a novel data-driven method called multisubspace orthogonal canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is proposed, which can not only tell whether the fault occurs but can also judge whether the fault affects the product quality in real time. First, to reduce process analysis complexity and to construct an accurate monitoring model, the original process variable space is divided into four subspaces. Second, the developed orthogonal CCA is conducted on process data and quality data for correlation feature extraction. Then, the quality-related and quality-unrelated features are obtained. Afterward, a total of six monitoring statistics are constructed and integrated to four statistics with physical interpretation via the Bayesian fusion strategy. Finally, the developed method is tested under an industrial case. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	28

First, a novel conditional convolutional autoencoder taking a multivariate set of data as input is developed to derive reconstruction errors, which reflect changes of system dynamics caused by impending blade breakages. Next, a statistical process control principle is applied to develop boundaries for triggering blade breakage alarms based on reconstruction errors. The effectiveness of the conditional convolutional autoencoder-based method is validated with datasets collected by supervisory control and data acquisition systems installed in multiple commercial wind farms. We also demonstrate advantages of the conditional convolutional autoencoder-based monitoring method by benchmarking against the classical autoencoder and conditional autoencoder-based monitoring methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11
1158	Empowering IoT Predictive Maintenance Solutions with AI: A Distributed System for Manufacturing Plant-Wide Monitoring	The emergence of Industry 4.0 and the rapid advances in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) have provided manufacturers with the ability to remotely monitor the process by deploying automatic fault detection in an IoT-based predictive maintenance system. However, the monitoring targets are now manufacturing plant-wide instead of being just a local area. Multiple types of faults are involved and the conventional centralized cloud computing-based IoT solutions always lead to a heavy burden on the network bandwidth due to the large amount of sensor data collected frequently that has to be transmitted to the central server and this leads to poor response time for the monitoring system. To address this problem, this article develops an artificial intelligence-assisted distributed system for manufacturing plant-wide predictive maintenance applications. The developed distributed system relies on the feature selection technique to identity an optimal feature subset for each type of fault and is enabled by deploying each independent model built on the obtained feature subset into different edge nodes. The distributed approach enables the data to be processed near the sensors, requiring less data to be transmitted to the central cloud server reducing network delay and delivering more accurate results. In addition, our proposed feature selection approach is especially designed to accommodate the characteristics of IIoT data such as the lack of labels. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the widely used public Tennessee Eastman dataset. © 2021 IEEE	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9
1159	Toward Proactive and Efficient DDoS Mitigation in IIoT Systems: A Moving Target Defense Approach	Nowadays, a large number of intelligent devices involved in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment lead to unprecedented challenges in security. Due to limited resources with weak security protection, the IIoT devices can be easily compromised to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, resulting in catastrophic results. Although there are many DDoS mitigations of traditional static schemes, the proactive defense method to resist attacks has not been well studied. Furthermore, existing proactive schemes ignored the delay-sensitive characteristic of applications under the IIoT environments. To address these issues, we first adopt two kinds of moving target defense (MTD) techniques that dynamically control the admission of devices and migrate service replicas to isolate attackers on limited edge clouds and mitigate DDoS attacks early near its source. Then, we formulate a multistage optimization problem of MTD mechanisms deployment and model it as constrained Markov decision processes in order to maximize the available resources of the system under the limitations of the IIoT environments. Besides, we present an MTD optimal strategy algorithm to solve decision problems in a cost-effective manner. In this article, the proposed algorithm can achieve an optimal admission allocation by means of attackers gathering within the same service where the service migration decisions are assisted by means of value iteration. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm, compared with existing strategies, can effectively mitigate DDoS attacks with acceptable degradation of the quality of service. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3

Then, a container-based industrial edge computing framework is designed to deploy the Fed-TH as a threat-hunting microservice on suitable edge servers while maintaining decent resource orchestration. To tackle the latency issue of an ICSP, an exploratory microservice placement method is introduced to enable better microservice deployment based on the computational resources of the participants.

Specifically, a weight-based fusion mechanism is designed in the first stage, while the second stage is featured by a linear convolution-based transformation with element removal from the convolution output to increase the security and protection. The proposed authentication system satisfies all the requirements of cancelable biometrics: accuracy, revocability, and diversity, unlinkability, and noninvertibility. Evaluated over six public fingerprint databases, the proposed authentication system exhibits highly competitive performance when compared with the existing cancelable fingerprint templates.

Dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) technique can make the user search the dynamic healthcare information from IIoTH system under the condition that the privacy is protected. In this article, a novel privacy-preserving DSSE scheme for IIoTH system is proposed. It is the first DSSE scheme designed for personal health record (PHR) files database with forward security. We construct the secure index based on hash chain and realize trapdoor updates for resisting file injection attacks. In addition, we realize fine-grained search over encrypted PHR files database of attribute-value type. When the user executes search operations, he/she gets only a matched attribute value instead of the whole file. As a result, the communication cost is reduced and the disclosure of patient's privacy is minimized. The proposed scheme also achieves attribute access control, which allows users have different access authorities to attribute values.

1163	A Recursive Method for Estimating Missing Data in Spatio-Temporal Applications	Missing data is a major data reliability problem in spatio-temporal (ST) applications. This article proposes an online method for estimating missing data in case of a network of n sensors. The true sensor value at a specific location is expressed using an integro-difference equation. The Karhunen-Loeve Expansion of the spatial process allows one to represent the ST field values at n locations in the form of a linear state-space model. The parameters of the model are identified using the maximum likelihood method. The parameters are updated in a rolling window approach. Whenever missing data are encountered, the algorithm predicts the missing observations based on the constrained solution of state evolution equation. The constrained solution is obtained by representing the optimal state as the orthogonal sum decomposition of a deterministic and a stochastic component. The utility of the algorithm is presented on two sensor network datasets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	
1164	Resilient Cyber-Physical Energy Systems Using Prior Information Based on Gaussian Process	The power grid infrastructure is a large-scale, heterogeneous, and complex cyber-physical system, which forms the lifeline of modern societies. The trend of tight coupling of physics, communication, and computation in cyber-physical energy systems (CPESs) is evident by the inclusion of numerous measurement sensors. This contributes to enhancing the monitoring and control functionalities of CPESs. At the same time, the occurrence of adverse effects constitutes a vital dimension of CPES operation. Increasing the resilience of critical energy systems is of key importance for safeguarding the national economy and security. This article considers the problem of optimal estimation with sensing measurements subject to arbitrary corruption resulting from adverse effects. Such signals can cause false situation awareness and/or trigger a sequence of cascading effects leading to an ultimate system failure. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization with additional prior information posed as a set inclusion constraint on the measurement vector. It is shown that if the prior set satisfies certain conditions, the resulting recovery error bound is improved. The approach demonstrates enhancement of the CPES resiliency by using the Gaussian process as the basis of a prior generative probabilistic regression model using historical data. The validation of the resiliency mechanism using prior information is performed using the New York Independent System Operator grid data, demonstrating 100% successful state recovery for up to 60% of CPES sensor failures. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
1165	Cyber-Resilient Multi-Energy Management for Complex Systems	Resilience problems from cyber-attacks on information communication technologies exist under their wide usage. False data injection (FDI) judiciously designed by attackers may cause severe consequences such as uneconomic operation and blackouts, particularly multivector energy distribution systems (MEDS), which are closely linked and interdependent. This article addresses the cyber resilient issues of an MEDS caused by FDI, considering the uncertainty from renewable resources. A novel two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is proposed to realize the day-ahead and real-time resilience improvement. The ambiguity set is based on both the Wasserstein distance and moment information. Compared to robust optimization which considers the worst case, DRO yields less-conservative solutions and thus provides more economic operation schemes. The Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set enables to provide additional flexibility hedging against renewable uncertainty. Case studies are demonstrated on two representative MEDS networked with energy hubs, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed cybersecured model. The produced adaptive robust economic operation for MEDS can reduce load shedding and enhance system resilience against severe cyberattacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

In this article, we propose DRLTrack, a framework for target tracking with a collaborative DRL called C-DRL in Edge-IoT with the aim to obtain two major objectives: high quality of tracking (QoT) and resource-efficient network performance. In DRLTrack, a huge number of IoT devices are employed to collect data about a target of interest. One or two edge devices in the network coordinate with a group of IoT devices and collaboratively detect the target by using the C-DRL approach and form an area around the target by the group of IoT devices. To maintain such an area during the tracking time, we employ a deep Q-network to track the target from one group to another. An EdgeAI sitting on the top of the edge devices has the control of the C-DRL approach during tracking and can identify a sequence of tracks. DRLTrack is said to be trustworthy as it shows trustworthy performance in terms of QoT, dynamic environments, and even under certain cyberattacks. We validate the performance of DRLTrack considering the objectives through simulations and it demonstrates superior performance compared with existing work. © 2021 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
1168	A Novel Covert Communication Method Based on Bitcoin Transaction	With the global promotion and application of 5G technology, the data transmitted on the network show explosive growth, and the secure sharing of its important data is still one of the research hotspots. Steganography embeds the data that needs to be shared into digital carrier files and transmits it through open channels, which has important applications in protecting data sharing and realizing covert communication. However, the encrypted files generated by traditional steganography are susceptible to compression, cropping, geometric attacks, and man-made destruction in the process of open channel transmission, resulting in data loss, making it difficult for the receiver to correctly extract secret message. Currently, covert communication on blockchain can solve the above problems, but it also brings some new problems such as high computational complexity, low transmission efficiency, and nondetection resistance. Therefore, in this article, a covert communication method based on Bitcoin transactions is proposed. The proposed method first designs the index matrix of the transaction address. Then, the address interaction relationship that carries the secret message through the transaction index matrix is constructed. Finally, the address interaction relationship that carries the secret message is combined with the transaction amount to complete the covert transmission of the secret message on the blockchain environment. The proposed method improves the security and embedding efficiency of covert communication, reduces the number of transactions, and ensures the integrity of extracting secret message. A series of experimental results show that under the condition of ensuring the necessary security, the proposed method retains the strong robustness of the existing blockchain steganography and has strong resistance to detection. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7

However, the main concern is the potential serious privacy leakage of the system. In this article, we take Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an example and design a convenient and privacy-preserving system named ADDetector with the assistance of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and security mechanisms. Particularly, to achieve effective AD detection, ADDetector only collects user's audio by IoT devices widely deployed in the smart home environment and utilizes novel topic-based linguistic features to improve the detection accuracy. For the privacy breach existing in data, feature, and model levels, ADDetector achieves privacy-preserving by employing a unique three-layer (i.e., user, client, cloud, etc.) architecture. Moreover, ADDetector exploits federated learning (FL) based scheme to ensure the user owns the integrity of raw data and secure the confidentiality of the classification model and implement differential privacy (DP) mechanism to enhance the privacy level of the feature. Furthermore, to secure the model aggregation process between clients and cloud in FL-based scheme, a novel asynchronous privacy-preserving aggregation framework is designed.

1170	Privacy-Aware Cloud Auditing for GDPR Compliance Verification in Online Healthcare	Emerging multitenant cloud computing ecosystems allow multiple applications to share virtualized pool of computing and networking resources. As a result, such ecosystems are becoming increasingly prone to data privacy concerns (personal data leakages and unauthorized access). While cloud computing providers support robust security and privacy mechanisms (e.g., public key cryptography, firewalls, and virtual private networks, among many others), they lack mechanisms and frameworks to monitor, audit, and verify these data privacy concerns. The emergence of data protection regulations around the world, such as General Data Protection Regulation in Europe and the Data Protection Act in the U.K., further emphasizes the need to overcome these privacy limitations. In this article, a novel technique for monitoring, auditing, and verifying the operations carried out on a user's personal data in cloud computing ecosystems is proposed. Our research methodology leverages distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain and smart contracts) for developing an immutable recording technique, which transparently logs, monitors, and verifies the operations carried out on user data. Using a healthcare pharmacy scenario and extensive real-world experiments, we validate the feasibility of the proposed technique. The proposed work handles a large pool of requests ($>$13K) ensuring minimal latency ($\approx$50-60 ms) and overheads for three different service packages varied with respect to the number of actors and operations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1171	Lightweight Privacy and Confidentiality Preserving Anonymous Authentication Scheme for WBANs	The recent developments in the wireless body area networks (WBAN) play a vital role in the modern remote health care monitoring system. In WBAN, the deployed intelligent, resource-limited body sensors will collect the patient's biological information (BI) and communicate the same to the doctor for further action through the Internet. But during the communication among the WBAN entities, the privacy, security of the BI, and user's personal data need to be protected against various security threats. To address these security flaws, in this article, a computationally efficient privacy-preserving anonymous authentication scheme is proposed for resource-limited WBAN. Also, it preserves the physical security of sensors and the confidentiality of BI and provides conditional privacy to the WBAN users. The comprehensive security and performance evaluation phase ensures that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure in terms of computational and communication complexity when compared with the other conventional schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
1172	Power Grid Resilience Enhancement via Protecting Electrical Substations against Flood Hazards: A Stochastic Framework	Natural disasters, such as floods, may damage power system assets and lead to widespread and long outages. The impact of flood can be alleviated by preventive actions such as installing tiger dams around power substations before the flood. In this regard, it is imperative that critical substations are identified in terms of the connected load and imposed costs to the system. This article presents a stochastic resource allocation approach for protecting power substations against flood events a day ahead of the event. Flood probability distribution functions are used to generate several flood scenarios at each substation. Using flood scenarios and substations' fragility, damage, and repair time curves obtained from historical data, the failure probability, damage percentage, damage cost, and repair time of substations are estimated. A day-ahead risk-aware stochastic scheduling model is proposed to identify the critical substations whose protection by tiger dams maximizes grid resilience. The risk-aware approach prevents high cost and low resilience if a particular scenario with a low probability is realized. A scenario reduction method is developed to generate representative substation failure scenarios and reduce the computational cost of the optimization problem. The simulation results on a realistic 30-substation system show the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1173	Secure Heterogeneous Data Deduplication via Fog-Assisted Mobile Crowdsensing in 5G-Enabled IIoT	Mobile crowdsensing provides the data collection and sharing for the 5G-enabled industrial Internet of Things. However, the redundant and duplicated heterogeneous sensing data bring unnecessary heavy storage and communication overhead. In this article, we propose a secure heterogeneous data deduplication scheme, which introduces the privacy-preserving cosine similarity computing to eliminate the replicate sensing data without privacy leakage in mobile crowdsensing. Specifically, we use the proxy re-encryption algorithm to realize secure and accurate task assignment via fog-assisted mobile crowdsensing. Based on lightweight two-party random masking and polynomial aggregation techniques, we achieve the privacy-preserving cosine similarity computing protocol. Finally, we conduct the privacy analysis, and experimental results on real-world datasets show that our approach is practical and effective. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1174	Low-Rank Characteristic and Temporal Correlation Analytics for Incipient Industrial Fault Detection with Missing Data	In real industrial applications, process data may get corrupted due to failure of the measurement devices or errors in data management. Besides, incipient faults, which may evolve into serious accidents, are generally more difficult to be detected because of its small magnitudes. In this article, a robust canonical variate dissimilarity analysis method is proposed to detect incipient faults for industrial processes with missing value. According to the low-rank characteristic, the low-rank matrix decomposition (LRMD) method is applied to recover the missing elements and reduce the ambient noise for process data. The output results of LRMD model consist of a low-rank component and a sparse component, which indicate main variance and residual information of the inputted data, respectively. For each component, a canonical variate analysis) model is developed to extract the temporal correlation in the process data. Based on the obtained features, a total of three monitoring statistics are established to reflect the operation status of the online sample. Among them, a statistic is used to measure the static deviation of this sample, and other two indices are applied to evaluate the dissimilarity between the past and future canonical variates. A simulated process and a real industrial process are adopted to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed model can be well developed with incomplete training data and robustly detects the incipient faults for industrial applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	15
1175	A Stable AI-Based Binary and Multiple Class Heart Disease Prediction Model for IoMT	Heart disease seriously threatens human life due to high morbidity and mortality. Accurate prediction and diagnosis become more critical for early prevention, detection, and treatment. The Internet of Medical Things and artificial intelligence support healthcare services in heart disease monitoring, prediction, and diagnosis. However, most prediction models only predict whether people are sick, and rarely further determine the severity of the disease. In this article, we propose a machine learning based prediction model to achieve binary and multiple classification heart disease prediction simultaneously. We first design a Fuzzy-GBDT algorithm combining fuzzy logic and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to reduce data complexity and increase the generalization of binary classification prediction. Then, we integrate Fuzzy-GBDT with bagging to avoid overfitting. The Bagging-Fuzzy-GBDT for multiclassification prediction further classify the severity of heart disease. Evaluation results demonstrate the Bagging-Fuzzy-GBDT has excellent accuracy and stability in both binary and multiple classification predictions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1176	Effective Management of Energy Internet in Renewable Hybrid Microgrids: A Secured Data Driven Resilient Architecture	This article proposes a two-layer in-depth secured management architecture for the optimal operation of energy internet in hybrid microgrids. In the cyber layer of the proposed architecture, a two-level intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed to detect various cyber-attacks (i.e., Sybil attacks, spoofing attacks, false data injection attacks) on wireless-based advanced metering infrastructures. The sequential probability ratio testing approach is utilized in both levels of the proposed IDS to detect cyber-attacks based on a sequence of anomalies rather than only one piece of evidence. The process of making a decision in the proposed IDS is a random walk that starts from a point between two thresholds and moves toward one of them concerning received data samples. The feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture are examined on the IEEE 33-bus test system and the results are provided for both islanded and grid-connected operation modes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
1177	Joint Protection of Energy Security and Information Privacy for Energy Harvesting: An Incentive Federated Learning Approach	Energy harvesting (EH) is a promising and critical technology to mitigate the dilemma between the limited battery capacity and the increasing energy consumption in the Internet of everything. However, the current EH system suffers from energy-information cross threats, facing the overlapping vulnerability of energy deprivation and private information leakage. Although some existing works touch on the security of energy and information in EH, they treat these two issues independently, without collaborative and intelligent protection cross the energy side and information side. To address the aforementioned challenge, this article proposes a joint protection framework of energy security and information privacy for EH with an incentive federated learning approach. First, we design a federated-learning-based malicious energy user detection method according to energy status and behaviors to provide energy security protection. Second, a differential-privacy-empowered information preservation scheme is devised, where sensitive information is perturbed and protected by the customized demand-based noise. Third, a noncooperative-game-enabled incentive mechanism is established to encourage EH nodes to participate in the joint energy-information protection system. The proposed incentive mechanism derives the optimal energy-information security strategy for EH nodes and achieve a tradeoff between the protection of energy security and information privacy. Evaluation results have verified the effectiveness of our proposed joint protection mechanism. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
1178	A Blockchain-Enabled Privacy-Preserving Verifiable Query Framework for Securing Cloud-Assisted Industrial Internet of Things Systems	Advanced Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), such as smart grids, 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and supply chain 4.o, can be used to facilitate smart management. Nevertheless, IIoT systems generate huge amounts of data that need to be outsourced to the cloud for storing and providing real-time search facilities to end-users. Outsourcing IIoT data to a third-party cloud service provider (CSP) introduces several data privacy and integrity issues related to verifying the reliability of users' queries and aggregated outcomes. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based framework for provisioning a privacy-preserving and verifiable query facility to end-users in IIoT systems. The framework uses blockchain to store IoT data as on-chain data and the cloud to store extensive data (e.g., image) as off-chain data and provisioning search services to users by executing a query in both on-chain and off-chain data and generating an aggregated result. Besides, it introduces a new privacy-preserving query mechanism for ensuring sensitive data privacy during query execution. A data owner encrypts both on-chain and off-chain data in the privacy-preserving query mechanism before sending it to the blockchain and cloud. A CSP can perform search operations on the encrypted on-chain and off-chain data to ensure sensitive data privacy. A multisignature-powered query verification model is also built for the blockchain. The query verification model allows each blockchain node to endorse the query result individually and a user to verify the endorsement of the query result before use. The experiments revealed the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1179	Lyapunov-Based Control of a Nonlinear Multiagent System with a Time-Varying Input Delay under False-Data-Injection Attacks	This article introduces a Lyapunov-based nonlinear control scheme that mitigates false-data-injection (FDI) attacks in real time for a centralized multiagent system (MAS) with nonlinear Euler-Lagrange dynamics with additive disturbances and input delays. Since the state tracking error is faulty during FDI attacks, the central controller cannot solely rely on the state tracking error to coordinate the MAS. Therefore, a novel feedback signal is designed to address this challenge and to ensure that the MAS achieves the control objective. The proposed controller combines both learning and model-based approaches to estimate the agents' states and to detect and respond to FDI attacks. A neural network (NN) is used to detect the FDI attacks, where the update laws for the NN weights are designed based on the corresponding stability analysis. Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are used in the Lyapunov-based stability analysis to ensure semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded tracking. A simulation of multiagent robots with nonlinear Euler-Lagrange dynamics is provided, demonstrating the promising performance of the developed method to respond to FDI attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
1180	Blockchain Based Privacy Preserving Framework for Emerging 6G Wireless Communications	With the global rollout of fifth-generation communication networks, the development on sixth-generation (6G) communication network has begun. The 6G technology is an emerging technology that will meet the ever-increasing demands of evolving industrial services and applications. This technology consists of varied number of heterogeneous resources and communication protocols to guarantee the seamless access to the services. Because of its heterogeneous nature and authorization delegation, security is a major concern in 6G communication environment. The emerging blockchain technology can able to solve the aforementioned privacy and security challenges. The blockchain technique also offers enhanced services like openness, decentralization, immutability, trust free, and so on. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, this article proposes a novel idea of integration of privacy preserving blockchain framework with 6G communication network. We also propose an integrated system for blockchain radio access network as a reliable and stable model for 6G networking based on blockchain technology with improved efficiency and protection. Furthermore, the critical components of blockchain such as smart contract, consensus protocol, mathematical model, secure data sharing, and auditing are clearly defined and experimental results are analyzed. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
1181	Privacy-Preserving Baseline Load Reconstruction for Residential Demand Response Considering Distributed Energy Resources	Customer baseline load (CBL) reconstruction is a critical problem in residential demand response. The difficulty of residential CBL lies in the variability of both irregular consumption and on-site distributed energy resources. Targeting the CBL reconstruction of residential prosumers, a regression-based estimation scheme is proposed using stacked autoencoders (SAEs) under the federated learning (FL) framework. In the FL framework, each residential unit (RU) stores and trains data locally without sharing them with neighboring RUs or the independent third party (ITP) responsible for CBL reconstruction. Local updates containing no load information are exchanged with the ITP (server) for the training improvement. The FL framework can, thus, protect the privacy of customers. Experimental results show that the proposed FL-based cascaded SAE outperforms the baseline on all tests and achieves up to 62.5% improvement in reducing reconstruction error. Moreover, it has enhanced privacy-preserving knowledge-sharing ability, higher efficiency, and better stability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	
1182	Security and Privacy-Enhanced Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection in IoT Infrastructures	Internet of Things (IoT) anomaly detection is significant due to its fundamental roles of securing modern critical infrastructures, such as falsified data injection detection and transmission line faults diagnostic in smart grids. Researchers have proposed various detection methods fostered by machine learning (ML) techniques. Federated learning (FL), as a promising distributed ML paradigm, has been employed recently to improve detection performance due to its advantages of privacy-preserving and lower latency. However, existing FL-based methods still suffer from efficiency, robustness, and security challenges. To address these problems, in this article, we initially introduce a blockchain-empowered decentralized and asynchronous FL framework for anomaly detection in IoT systems, which ensures data integrity and prevents single-point failure while improving the efficiency. Further, we design an improved differentially private FL based on generative adversarial nets, aiming to optimize data utility throughout the training process. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a decentralized FL approach with privacy-preserving for IoT anomaly detection. Simulation results on the real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance from aspects of robustness, accuracy, and fast convergence while maintaining high level of privacy and security protection. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9

1184	DHACS: Smart Contract-Based Decentralized Hybrid Access Control for Industrial Internet-of-Things	The integration between blockchains, Internet-of-Thing (IoT), and smart contracts is an emerging and promising technology. The advantages of this technology have raised the importance of Industrial Internet-of-Thing (IIoT) and have paved the pathway for 'Industry 4.0.' Surprisingly, access control has received less attention in IIoTs. Though there are some solutions coming forward to use blockchains for IIoT to enable secure and resilient access control management, the challenge is to satisfy the low-latency requirements of IIoTs for validating and adding the blocks to the chain. Besides, role-based and rule-based access controls in the existing systems can be forged without organizational access controls and compliance. Therefore, we address these problems in this article. In the present work, we propose DHACS, a Decentralized Hybrid Access Control for Smart contract, for IIoTs. DHACS aims to provide transparency, reliability, and robustness to the existing access control mechanism in IIoTs. The framework is based on blockchain feasibilities that contribute to an interconnected hybrid access control through smart contract provision. It is a novel idea in the domain of IIoTs. We use three access control strategies, role-based, rule-based, and organization-based, to develop a hybrid approach for smart contract in DHACS. The operational transactions along with their access controls are accounted and blocks are made by the transaction pooler and block creator. We use a private blockchain environment; however, it can be extended to a public blockchain or consortium blockchain for geographical distributed dependency. We compare DHACS with three existing approaches in recent time. We measure the performance in terms of computational costs, storage complexity, and energy consumption. DHACS outperforms the others approaches and is considered to be efficient for IIoT applications with more than 30% better efficiency in access control management. To the best of our knowledge, DHACS is the first attempt to use decentralized blockchains with smart contract for hybrid access control in IIoTs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3

1186	Parallel Key-Insulated Multiuser Searchable Encryption for Industrial Internet of Things	With the rapid development of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and cloud computing, an increasing number of companies outsource their data to cloud servers to save costs. To protect data privacy, sensitive industrial data must be encrypted before being outsourced to cloud servers. A multiuser searchable encryption (MUSE) scheme was introduced to ensure high efficiency of encrypted data retrieval. In an IIoT system with numerous users, the existing MUSE schemes suffer from certain key exposure problems owing to the limited key protection of smart devices and frequent queries by users. In this article, we propose a parallel key-insulated MUSE scheme for IIoT. This scheme utilizes broadcast encryption technology to implement MUSE. In addition, our scheme introduces a key-insulated primitive to improve the tolerance to key exposure. The security of our scheme is proved in the random oracle model.

1187	An Intelligent and Trust UAV-Assisted Code Dissemination 5G System for Industrial Internet-of-Things	A large number of devices with communication and sensing capabilities are connected to the 5G network and facilitate distributed industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. Those devices can update their program code by using software-defined technologies and upgrade functions without hardware replacement, thus, greatly facilitating the development of IIoT applications. Disseminating code safely to these devices is a pivotal issue. However, the existing methods rarely consider whether the code received by devices is integrated. Therefore, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted trustworthy code dissemination (UTCD) framework in 5G-enabled intelligent IIoT systems is proposed to select credible mobile vehicles (MVs) to disseminate code with opportunistic routing style. In the UTCD framework, a verifiable trust evaluation scheme is proposed to identify the trust of the MVs by sending the UAV to collect the code wait to be verified (CWV) directly from the selected devices (bedrock devices) as evidence. This scheme is a fundamental change from the previous passive, indirect and unverifiable trust evaluation schemes. In UTCD, a bedrock devices selection scheme is presented by selecting as few bedrock devices as possible to collect as much the CWV as possible with the minimum cost. After that, based on the CWV, which is collected from bedrock devices, a complete trust evaluation scheme is proposed to obtain the trust of MVs. Furthermore, a UAV trajectory optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain as much CWV as possible within the limited conditions of UAV. Finally, comprehensive experiments conduct on a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of the efficiency and security of code dissemination. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6

Considering the cost of system utility caused by privacy protection technology, the tradeoff between local privacy and system utility is formalized a multiobjective optimization problem. The optimal solution is theoretically derived, and the optimal task allocation scheme is obtained. In addition, the selected allocation codebook (SAC) method is introduced to solve the problem of high computational resource consumption in the task allocation process and protect the task location privacy to some extent. The experimental results show that the SAC method sacrifices system utility but improves the privacy protection for task locations by 60% on average. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1189	SDN-Assisted Safety Message Dissemination Framework for Vehicular Critical Energy Infrastructure	The proliferation of fifth-generation (5G) networks toward vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has paved the way for driverless autonomous vehicles (AVs) in vehicular critical energy infrastructures (CEI). Though technological advancements improve AVs, the safety-critical messages (SCMs) still play a vital role in reducing crashes, preventing injuries, and saving lives. AVs' high speed and complex network topology challenge disseminating SCMs with a highly successful delivery ratio and extremely low latency. Furthermore, the typical SCM dissemination schemes cause channel congestion and minimize the delivery ratio, making the systems incompatible with the AVs. Therefore, in this article, a software-defined-networking-assisted continuous clustering approach called migrating consignment region (MiCR) based on the federated K-means algorithm is proposed for disseminating SCMs to the AVs via 5G V2X communication. Unlike other methods that create clusters for every instance of SCM dissemination, MiCR continuously holds moving clusters for disseminating SCMs to AVs with ultrahigh reliability and low latency. The proposed MiCR approach has been simulated under real-time highway road maps and compared with other methods. The simulation results prove the superiority of MiCR in terms of network overload, SCM delivery ratio, latency, dissemination efficiency, and collision rate compared with the existing methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1190	Edge Task Migration With 6G-Enabled Network in Box for Cybertwin-Based Internet of Vehicles	In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), various latency-critical and data-intensive applications have recently emerged to support smart traffic solutions. The sixth generation mobile networks (6G) greatly reduce the communication delay for the latency-critical tasks. However, the computing resources and execution efficiency for data-intensive tasks are still inadequate. The stationary edge computing (EC) servers, on the other hand, lack the flexibility to give service to moving vehicles. Therefore, Cybertwin is introduced in the IoV paradigm to provide a unified access point for EC. In addition, the 6G-enabled network in box (NIB) is deployed in vehicles to provide flexible computing power. However, in this article, the optimization of NIB task migration is still a challenge; thus, NIB task migration method (NTM) for IoV is proposed. The Pareto envelope-based selection algorithm is employed to determine the strategy. Finally, NTM is evaluated by a real-world dataset of the service requests. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1191	Reinforcement-Learning-Based Dynamic Spectrum Access for Software-Defined Cognitive Industrial Internet of Things	The cognitive industrial Internet of Things (CIIoT) can improve transmission performance by utilizing the spectrum licensed to a primary user (PU), providing that the normal communication of the PU is not disturbed. However, the traditional spectrum access schemes for the CIIoT are difficult to adapt to the various communication environments. In this article, Q-learning-based dynamic spectrum access is proposed for the CIIoT to intelligently utilize the spectrum resources in three access scenarios: orthogonal multiple access (OMA), underlay spectrum access, and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In the OMA scheme, the CIIoT learns to access the idle channels to avoid distributing the PUs, but its communication continuity cannot be guaranteed when most of the channels are occupied by the PUs. In the underlay scheme, the CIIoT learns to utilize the busy channels to ensure the communication continuity by limiting its transmit power within the tolerance of the PU. However, the interference to the PU cannot be eliminated, which will decrease the PU's throughput. In the NOMA scheme, however, the CIIoT can utilize the busy channels by canceling the interference to the PU with successive interference cancellation, which will guarantee the transmission performance of both the CIIoT and the PU. A Q-learning-based spectrum access algorithm is proposed to improve the transmission performance of the CIIoT in the three schemes. The simulation results have shown the advantages of the Q-learning-based NOMA scheme in terms of guaranteeing the throughput of the CIIoT nodes and decreasing the interference to the PUs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7

In particular, we propose optimal UAVs' path planing approaches for minimizing the completion time and total energy consumption of the UAVs' deployment for data collection. Two optimal schemes, namely, optimal energy consumption by peer-To-peer UAV-IoT sensing networks and optimal energy consumption by clustering UAV-IoT sensing networks, are considered. The low-complexity procedures of our advanced optimization techniques are suitably applied to disaster relief networks when the solving time must be strictly adhered to. Our real-Time optimization algorithms result in low computational complexity with fast deployment and low processing time for solving the problem of tracking and gathering sensor data, i.e., in very short time (milliseconds).

1193	Cloud-Edge Collaborative SFC Mapping for Industrial IoT Using Deep Reinforcement Learning	The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and 5G have been served as the key elements to support the reliable and efficient operation of Industry 4.0. By integrating burgeoning network function virtualization (NFV) technology with cloud computing and mobile edge computing, an NFV-enabled cloud-edge collaborative IIoT architecture can efficiently provide flexible service for the massive IIoT traffic in the form of a service function chain (SFC). However, the efficient cloud-edge collaboration, the reasonable comprehensive resource consumption, and different quality of services are still key problems to be solved. Thus, to balance the quality of IIoT services, as well as computational and communicational resource consumption, a multiobjective SFC deployment model is designed to characterize the diverse service requirements and specific network environment for the IIoT. Then, a deep-Q-learning-based online SFC deployment algorithm is presented, which can efficiently learn the relationship between the SFC deployment scheme and its performance through the iterative training. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms others in balancing the resource consumption, accepting more SFC requests, as well as providing differentiated services for delay-sensitive IIoT traffic and resource-intensive IIoT traffic. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1194	Privacy-Preserving Federated Depression Detection From Multisource Mobile Health Data	Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses, and the symptoms shown by patients are different, making it difficult to diagnose in the process of clinical practice and pathological research. Although researchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of depression, the traditional centralized machine learning methods need to aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness needs to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms' clinical application. To solve the problem of medical data privacy with depression, in this article, we implement a study of federated learning to analyze and diagnose depression. First, we propose a general multiview federated learning framework using multisource data, which can extend any traditional machine learning model to support federated learning across different institutions or parties. Second, we employ later fusion methods to solve the problem of inconsistent time series of multiview data. Finally, we compare the federated framework with other cooperative learning frameworks in performance and discuss the related results. The experimental results show that in the case of participating in federated learning with enough participants, the prediction accuracy of depression score can reach 85.13%, which is about 15% higher than local training. When the number of participants is small and the amount of data is sufficient, the prediction accuracy of depression score can also reach 84.32%, and the improvement rate is about 9%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
1195	An Effective Edge-Intelligent Service Placement Technology for 5G-and-Beyond Industrial IoT	With the rapid development of wireless communication, traditional cloud computing cannot fully support low-latency services, especially in sensor networks. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can improve the quality of experience of end users and save the energy consumption of mobile end devices by providing computing resources and storage space. However, it may cause discontinuity of services if these mobile end devices roam around different MEC servers' areas. To solve the aforementioned problem, in this article, we propose an effective edge-intelligent service placement algorithm (EISPA), which transforms the service placement problem into finding a globally optimal solution via nature-inspired particle swarm optimization (PSO). Moreover, we use a shrinkage factor and combine it with the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to adjust the position of particles in our algorithm, which aims to avoid falling into an optimal local solution to a certain extent. Performance analysis results show that the EISPA is approaching the optimal enumeration collaborative computation offloading algorithm, and system cost under energy constraints is 83.6%, 20.4%, and 20.3% lower than that in Only Local, Finding the Nearest Edge, and the genetic SA-based PSO algorithms, respectively, which proves that the EISPA has better performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1196	Establishing a Cybersecurity Home Monitoring System for the Elderly	Many countries have increasingly aging populations. Many of these elderly people live alone and independently, but those suffering from chronic diseases or disabilities are at risk of accidents that will require assistance. Many commercially available homecare systems provide remote monitoring functionality, but these systems require someone on the other end of the remote connection to be paying attention. This raises the need for intelligent home monitoring systems to ensure continuous awareness of user safety. This article proposes a system using beacon technology to assess subject well being based on lack of movement, and automatically activates prepositioned cameras and send an alert to family members or caregivers in response to potentially high-risk activity, such as activating particular kitchen appliances. However, the use of such cameras raises privacy concerns.

1197	Real-Time Predictive Control for Chemical Distribution in Sewer Networks Using Improved Elephant Herding Optimization	As a critical infrastructure of urban water systems, sewer networks suffer from serious corrosion and odor problems, which can be controlled by chemical dosing. It is a challenging task to optimize chemical distribution in such a hybrid system with continuous hydraulic flow, discrete pump operations, and dynamic constraints. In this article, we study real-time control of multiple pumps to achieve the desired chemical distribution in a sewer network. A novel hybrid optimization approach is developed, which involves an event-triggered scheme triggered by predicting proper pumping events at uncontrolled pumping stations, and an improved nature-inspired elephant herding optimization (iEHO) algorithm for scheduling pumping at controllable pumping stations. The proposed method is validated through simulation studies of a real-life sewer network using real measured data. Our strategy significantly improves chemical distribution with reduced costs, despite an astronomic searching space. The iEHO algorithm outperforms the genetic algorithm in terms of the quality of solutions and convergence efficiency. © 2020 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1198	Deep Learning-Based Privacy Preservation and Data Analytics for IoT Enabled Healthcare	With the development of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), intelligent healthcare aims to build a platform to monitor users' health-related information based on wearable devices remotely. The evolution of blockchain and artificial intelligence technology also promotes the progress of secure intelligent healthcare. However, since the data are stored in the cloud server, it still faces the risk of being attacked and privacy leakage. Note that little attention has been paid to the security issue of privacy information mixed in raw data collected from large number of distributed and heterogeneous wearable healthcare devices. To solve this problem, in this article, we design a deep learning-based privacy preservation and data analytics system for IoT enabled healthcare. At the user end, we collect raw data and separate the users' privacy information in the privacy-isolation zone. At the cloud end, we analyze the health-related data without users' privacy information and construct a delicate security module based on the convolutional neural network. We also deploy and evaluate the prototype system, where extensive experiments prove its effectiveness and robustness. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1199	A Container-Driven Service Architecture to Minimize the Upgrading Requirements of User-Side Smart Meters in Distribution Grids	Advances in information and communication technologies have significantly influenced the operation of low-voltage distribution grids. As essential elements of distribution grids, user-side smart meters find many smart grid applications, for example to measure electrical energy use and facilitate communications. However, the service models of distribution grids remain under development in association with upgrading of user-side smart meters. These meters are resource constrained, and challenging to upgrade on a large scale. To address this issue, this article describes a container-driven service architecture, in which containers are used to create a virtual dedicated agent (digital twin) for each user-side smart meter. The agent can be deployed either in the cloud or on an edge system, and can be upgraded to support emerging smart grid applications, thus minimizing the future upgrading requirements of user-side smart meters. We built experimental test beds to verify the proposed architecture and evaluated its performance in real-world experiments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1200	Federated Learning for Cybersecurity: Concepts, Challenges, and Future Directions	Federated learning (FL) is a recent development in artificial intelligence, which is typically based on the concept of decentralized data. As cyberattacks are frequently happening in the various applications deployed in real time, most industrialists are hesitating to move forward in adopting the technology of the Internet of Everything. This article aims to provide an extensive study on how FL could be utilized for providing better cybersecurity and prevent various cyberattacks in real time.

1201	Federated tensor decomposition-based feature extraction approach for industrial IoT	Data in modern industrial applications and data science present multidimensional progressively, the dimension and the structural complexity of these data are becoming extremely high, which renders existing data analysis methods and machine learning algorithms inadequate to the extent. In addition, high-dimensional data in actual scenarios often share some common latent components and patterns, it is necessary and significant to analyze such data in an associative manner, rather than treating them independently. Considering the problem of data islands and data privacy that is prevalent in the industry. In this article, we propose the first joint high-order orthogonal iterative (J-HOOI) algorithm for simultaneous tensor decomposition and federated tensor decomposition (FTD) model for feature extraction and dimension reduction of high-dimensional industrial data under the federated learning framework. Moreover, we also develop a secure federated computation process based on the J-HOOI method. Using this method, multiple participants iteratively calculate the local factor matrices and transfer the local information to the parameter server, which aggregates the local information to generate the globally updated factor matrices. Finally, each client generates globally compressed features by projecting local data onto these common potential spaces. We have demonstrated with real-world industrial datasets that our approach is similar to a centralized training model in decomposition accuracy and classification accuracy while respecting privacy. © 2021 IEEE.	2021	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1202	Blockchain-Empowered Decentralized Horizontal Federated Learning for 5G-Enabled UAVs	Motivated by Industry 4.0, 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones) are widely applied in various industries. However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the abovementioned issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal FL framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	52
1203	A Privacy Enhanced Authentication Scheme for Securing Smart Grid Infrastructure	The rapid advancements in smart grid (SG) technology extend a large number of applications including vehicle charging, smart buildings, and smart cities through the efficient use of advanced communication architecture. However, the underlying public channel leads these services to be vulnerable to many threats. Recently, some security schemes were proposed to counter these threats. However, the insecurities of some of these schemes against key compromise impersonation (KCI) and related attacks or compromise on efficiency calls for a secure and efficient authentication scheme for SG infrastructure. A new scheme to secure SG communication is presented in this article to provide a direct device-to-device authentication among smart meter and neighborhood area network gateway. Designed specifically to resists KCI and related attacks, the proposed scheme is more secure and completes the authentication procedure by using the least communication cost as compared with related schemes, which is evident through security and efficiency comparisons. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
1204	Hybrid Malware Detection Based on Bi-LSTM and SPP-Net for Smart IoT	In this article, we propose the hybrid malware detection scheme, HyMalD, with bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and the spatial pyramid pooling network (SPP-Net). Its purpose is to protect Internet of Things (IoT) devices and minimize the damage caused by infection through obfuscated malware. HyMalD performs the static and dynamic analyses logically simultaneously to detect obfuscated malware, which is impossible to do using static analysis alone. First, it extracts static features of the opcode sequence using a reconstructed dataset according to the obfuscation and extracts the application programming interface (API) call sequence dynamically. The extracted features are trained through the Bi-LSTM and SPP-Net models, which HyMalD uses to detect and classify IoT malware. The performance of HyMalD was evaluated, and its detection accuracy was 92.5%. The false-negative rate (FNR) of HyMalD was 7.67%. Thus, HyMalD detects IoT malware more accurately and with a lower FNR than in the static analysis, which had 92.09% detection accuracy and 9.97% FNR. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1205	AF Relaying Secrecy Performance Prediction for 6G Mobile Communication Networks in Industry 5.0	Industry 5.0 has developed in full swing, and accelerated the process of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication. Physical layer security is important for complex 6G mobile communication networks. To process active complex events in 6G mobile cooperative networks, predicting secrecy performance in time is essential for the mobile communication quality evaluation. Using amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying, we propose a transmit antenna selection (TAS) based secrecy scheme in this article. To analyze the security of 6G mobile cooperative networks, signal-to-noise ratio of the end-to-end link is used to derive the novel expressions for secrecy outage probability (SOP). The theoretical results are confirmed by simulation results. Then, we use SOP as the important merit to evaluate the secrecy performance, and set up the dataset. To achieve secrecy performance prediction, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based SOP prediction algorithm is proposed. The designed CNN model has five convolution layers, which all use the same convolution in the padding and do not change data size. For this improved CNN structure, we adopt the idea of SqueezeNet, which belongs to the lightweight CNN. The improved CNN model can greatly reduce the parameters and network complexity on the premise of ensuring the prediction accuracy. We also examine the following state-of-the-art techniques, first, Elman, second, InceptionNet, third, deep neural network (DNN), and fourth, support vector machine methods. The proposed CNN algorithm can achieve better SOP prediction results than other existing methods. In particular, compared with DNN method, the prediction accuracy is increased by 66.7%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1206	Delay-Sensitive Secure NOMA Transmission for Hierarchical HAP-LAP Medical-Care IoT Networks	Medical-care Internet of Things enables rapid medical assistance by providing comprehensive and clear healthy information. However, due to the limited infrastructure, it is difficult to quickly and securely transmit medical-care information in poverty-stricken or disaster-stricken areas. To tackle the above situation, in this article, we propose a delay-sensitive secure nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission scheme with the high-altitude platform (HAP) and low-altitude platforms (LAPs) cooperated to securely provide delay-sensitive medical-care services. In the proposed scheme, we first design a novel HAP-LAP secure transmission framework to provide NOMA communication services to multiple hotspots. Constrained by the limited power and spectrum, we formulate an optimization problem, such that the privacy information delay is minimized. For thisnonconvex optimization problem, we design an alternating optimization framework, where the power, spectrum, and LAPs' location are tackled in turn. In addition, we theoretically analyze the performance superiority compared with the orthogonal multiple access scheme and derive the secrecy outage probability closed-form expression. Finally, numerical results show the performance superiority of the proposed scheme compared with the current works with respect to the secure information delay. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	42
1207	PACMAN: Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme for Managing Cybertwin-Based 6G Networking	Security and privacy of data-in-transit are critical issues in Industry 4.0, which are further amplified by the use of faster communication technologies such as 6G. Along with security issues, computation and communication costs, as well as data confidentiality, must be also accommodated. In this article, we design a cybertwin-based cloud-centric network architecture to improve the flexibility and scalability of 6G industrial networks. Cybertwin not only enables the deployment of advanced security solutions but also provides an always-on connection. However, the security of data-in-transit over wireless communication between users/things and cybertwin remains a concern. Hence, a privacy-preserving authentication scheme based on digital signature and authenticated key exchange protocol is designed to address the security concerns of data exchanged. In addition, we conduct a security analysis that proves that the scheme resists several attacks in the Industry 4.0 environment.

1210	Privacy-Preserving Prediction of Victim's Mortality and Their Need for Transportation to Health Facilities	Emergency medical services (EMS) provide crucial prehospital care, such as in the case of cardiac arrest, where the victim requires immediate first-aid. For this reason, it is vital to improving EMS response time. This article proposes a novel methodology based on machine learning (ML) techniques to predict both the victims' mortality and their need for transportation to health facilities using data gathered from the start of the emergency call until the Departmental Fire and Rescue Service of the Doubs (SDIS25) is notified. We first analyzed SDIS25 calls to find out associations between the call processing times and victims' mortality, and to measure the variables' importance. Next, we validated our proposed ML-based methodology, where mortality could be predicted with accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 96.44% and 96.04%, respectively, while the need for transportation achieved an accuracy and AUC scores of 73.62% and 78.91%, respectively. What is more, we found out that it was still possible to predict both targets perturbating the input data by applying k-anonymity and differential privacy techniques. In conclusion, the results showed the potential of ML for EMS, which can be used as a decision-support tool to early identify mortality and the use of resources (transportation) and, thus, help EMS to save more lives and avoid service disruptions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1211	Towards Energy-Efficient and Secure Data Transmission in AI-Enabled Software Defined Industrial Networks	Currently, increasing attention is devoted to artificial intelligence (AI) enabled software defined industrial networks (AI-SDINs). Toward energy-efficient and secure data transmission in AI-SDINs, a metric called energy-cost-per-useful-bit (ECPUB), which means energy cost of transmitting per useful bit is presented to evaluate energy efficiency and a novel energy-efficiency based secure multipath routing scheme is then put forward. Specifically, the ECPUB incorporates the utility and the law of diminishing marginal utility, for revealing the relationship among energy consumption, residual energy, and useful bits required. Moreover, in this article, an energy-efficiency based secure multipath routing scheme (E2SMR) is proposed by adopting the ECPUB and (t, n) threshold secret sharing scheme, for enhancing the security under the premise of guaranteeing energy efficiency. Extensive simulation results show that ECPUB can evaluate the energy efficiency and facilitate the balance of network load, while E2SMR can prolong the lifetime of the network and simultaneously ensure the network functionality securely. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4

However, the existing privacy protection methods ignore the spatio-temporal correlation of trajectory data, resulting in a large error in trajectory proportion estimation and Top-K classification. For the privacy of truck trajectory in intelligent logistics, the location and trajectory data perturbation method based on quadtree indexing is proposed, which leverages location generalization and local differential privacy techniques. Our proposed algorithms are suitable for datasets with a large sample space and can protect the trajectory privacy of truck drivers while preserving the strong correlation between adjacent spatio-temporal nodes in the trajectory. The results of simulation on a real trajectory dataset show that the proposed methods not only meet the trajectory privacy requirements of users but also have a good performance in trajectory proportion estimation and Top-K classification. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1213	Adding Redundancy to LoRaWAN for Emergency Communications at the Factory Floor	Wireless communications may be the key solution to satisfy mobility, flexibility, and scalability requirements of the Internet of Things. Particularly, the low power wide area networks, operating in unlicensed bands, are promising because they permit both private and public backends. Unfortunately, their target applications are situations where sporadic transmissions are tolerated. They could not fit scenarios in which high reliability and short round trip time are required. In this article, the LoRaWAN solution is considered for managing emergency and alarm communications. Reliability and timeliness limits have been overcome by jointly using a message replication scheme with variable payload length together with low-cost repeaters. Experiments have been carried out in both fixed and low-speed mobility scenarios (with an interfering traffic of 95 message/h, generated by regular LoRaWAN colocated network). Results, in the former case, show that the success probability of confirmed messages is 100%, the 99.6% of the available data are delivered to the backend, and the average delay decreases by 150 ms. When mobility is considered (e.g., for an automatic guided vehicle use case) results confirm significant improvements for both the transaction success ratio and the data extraction rate that significantly increase up to 95% and 87%, respectively. On the contrary, the overall average delay is not always reduced. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1214	QoS and Privacy-Aware Routing for 5G-Enabled Industrial Internet of Things: A Federated Reinforcement Learning Approach	The development and maturity of the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication technology provides the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with ultra-reliable and low-latency communications and massive machine-type communications, and forms a novel IIoT architecture, 5G-IIoT. However, massive data transfer between interconnecting industrial devices also brings new challenges for the 5G-IIoT routing process in terms of latency, load balancing, and data privacy, which affect the development of 5G-IIoT applications. Moreover, the existing research works on IIoT routing mostly focus on the latency and the reliability of the routing, disregarding the privacy security in the routing process. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose a quality of service (QoS) and data privacy-aware routing protocol, named QoSPR, for 5G-IIoT. Specifically, we improve the community detection algorithm info-map to divide the routing area into optimal subdomains, based on which the deep reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to build the gateway deployment model for latency reduction and load-balancing improvement. To eliminate areal differences, while considering the privacy preservation of the routing data, the federated reinforcement learning is applied to obtain the universal gateway deployment model. Then, based on the gateway deployment, the QoS and data privacy-aware routing is accomplished by establishing communications along the load-balancing routes of the minimum latencies. The validation experiment is conducted on real datasets. The experiment results show that as a data privacy-aware routing protocol, the QoSPR can significantly reduce both average latency and maximum latency, while maintaining excellent load balancing in 5G-IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
1215	Mission Effective Capacity-A Novel Dependability Metric: A Study Case of Multiconnectivity-Enabled URLLC for IIoT	Various industrial Internet of Things applications demand execution periods throughout which no communication failure is tolerated. However, the classical understanding of reliability in the context of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) does not reflect on the time-varying characteristics of the wireless channel. In this article, we introduce a novel mission reliability and mission effective capacity metric that takes these phenomena medium into account, while specifically studying multiconnectivity (MC)-enabled industrial radio systems. We assume uplink short packet transmission with no channel state information at URLLC user (the transmitter) and sporadic traffic arrival. Moreover, we leverage the existing framework of dependability theory and provide closed-form expressions (CFEs) for the mission reliability of the MC system using the maximal-ratio combining scheme. We do so by utilizing the mean time to first failure, which is the expected time of failure occurring for the first time. Moreover, we also derive exact CFEs for second-order statistics, such as level crossing rate and average fade duration, showing how fades are distributed in fading channels with respect to time. Furthermore, the design throughput maximization problem under the mission reliability constraint is solved numerically through the cross-entropy method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1216	Delay Minimization for NOMA-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing in Industrial Internet of Things	Mobile edge computing and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been considered as promising technologies that can satisfy rigorous requirements of industrial Internet of Things systems. However, system dynamics, including channel states and computation task requests, may continuously change NOMA decoding order and computation uploading time, making it difficult to reduce latency using conventional highly complex optimization methods. In this article, we investigate a novel scheme that effectively reduces the average task delay to improve the quality of service for all users by jointly optimizing subchannel assignment (SA), offloading decision (OD), and computation resource allocation (CRA). To deal with the high complexity, the original multiserver problem is first decomposed into multiple single-server problems. Subsequently, each single-server problem is decoupled into CRA and SA/OD subproblems. Using convex optimization, a closed-form solution is derived for the optimal CRA action. Concurrently, the optimal SA/OD action is obtained using a distributed multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes. In particular, it reduces the action decision duration by 30 times while achieving a near-optimal performance of up to 97% of the optimum under the exhaustive search scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

By offloading compute-intensive tasks from IoT devices to edge/cloud servers, the communication and computation pressure caused by the massive data in Industrial IoT can be effectively reduced. In the process of computation offloading in edge computing, it is critical to dynamically make optimal offloading decisions to minimize the delay and energy consumption spent on the devices. Although there are a large number of task offloading-decision models, how to measure and evaluate the quality of different models and configurations is crucial. In this article, we propose a novel simulation platform named ChainFL, which can build an edge computing environment among IoT devices while being compatible with federated learning and blockchain technologies to better support the embedding of security-focused offloading algorithms. ChainFL is lightweight and compatible, and it can quickly build complex network environments by connecting devices of different architectures. Moreover, due to its distributed nature, ChainFL can also be deployed as a federated learning platform across multiple devices to enable federated learning with high security due to its embedded blockchain.

Although federated learning (FL) has promoted distributed collaborative learning while keeping natural compliance with the privacy protection, it is tremendously difficult to schedule edge nodes of CEI collaboratively when asynchronous FL tasks are applied in CEI system, since the CEI system must make an irrevocable immediate decision on whether to hire a participant who arrives and departs dynamically without knowing future information. In this article, we tackle this issue by designing fairness-aware and time-sensitive task allocation mechanisms in asynchronous FL for CEI. First, we design an optimal multidimensional contract to guarantee the reliability, honesty, and fairness, and maximize the learning accuracy for the fixed deadline scenario. Second, we design a multimetric participant recruitment mechanism to control time consumption for the limited budget scenario, prove that the problem of optimizing this mechanism is NP-hard, and propose an e-approximation algorithm accordingly.

The SDN controller can dynamically split the network into multiple virtual networks according to different business requirements. On this basis, we proposed a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based slice optimization algorithm. It enables LoRa gateways to intelligently configure slice parameters (e.g., transmission power and spreading factor) to improve the slice performance in terms of QoS, energy efficiency, and reliability. In addition, to accelerate the training process across multiple LoRa gateways, we leverage the transfer learning framework and design a transfer learning-based multiagent DDPG algorithm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5

1225	Distributed Orchestration of Service Function Chains for Edge Intelligence in the Industrial Internet of Things	Network virtualization techniques are promising to overcome the obstacle of applying and expanding costly traditional networks in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT). Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced distributed resource management in edge networks has aroused researchers' widespread attention. However, dynamically arrived service requests and limited edge resources complicate the service scheduling issue. In this article, we establish a dynamic network virtualization technique enabled service function chain (SFC) orchestration framework in IIoT, formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize total utility and decompose it into two subproblems, i.e., SFC selection and dynamic SFC orchestration. A dynamic orchestration of SFC (DOS) scheme, consisting of resource-aware matching algorithm and averaged multistep double deep q-network algorithm, is designed to embed SFC requests distributedly on the optimal virtualized network function chains. At last, we validate the superiority of our proposed DOS scheme by experimental results. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

1227	SMA: SRv6-Based Multidomain Integrated Architecture for Industrial Internet	With the increasing requirements of industrial production efficiency, the Industrial Internet has played a very important role in the fourth industrial revolution. However, the current Industrial Internet still has many drawbacks, especially in terms of network systems, such as low network expansion, inconvenient troubleshooting, and low data transmission efficiency. For this motivation, a novel SRv6-based multidomain integrated architecture (SMA) for the Industrial Internet has been proposed. Multilayer controllers are deployed in the SMA, and a software-defined network controller that generates the transmission path is replaced by SMA nodes, which realizes the high network scalability and efficient data transmission of the Industrial Internet. The faulty node in the SMA can be quickly and accurately identified through the periodic detection actively sent by the controller node in the domain and the passive feedback of the SMA nodes, and the generated SMA node trusted set (SNTS) can be used for forwarding path generation. A Bellman-Ford algorithm with a hop count constraint based on the total number of SNTS nodes is proposed, which effectively avoids long-path forwarding and improves network resource utilization. Through theoretical analysis, the safety and scalability of the SMA have been fully verified. The simulation results of the SMA on the experimental platform show that the SMA is superior to the existing Industrial Internet network structure in terms of troubleshooting efficiency of faulty nodes, network throughput, and data communication overhead. In the Industrial Internet, when the proportion of SMA nodes reaches 30%, the SMA controller can control nearly 80% of the traffic. In addition, the maximum link utilization rate will be greatly reduced, which means better adjustment of network load balance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1228	5G Private Network Deployment Optimization Based on RWSSA in Open-Pit Mine	5G communication network is vital to the intelligent and unmanned technology of open-pit mine, but the high cost of 5G base station deployment will bring huge cost increases to mining enterprises. Thus, this article proposes an improved sparrow search algorithm (SSA) using random walk strategy (RWSSA) to optimization the distribution and signal coverage of 5G base stations in open-pit mine. In order to verify the performance of the algorithm, the SSA, the modified ant lion optimizer, the particle swarm optimization, and the RWSSA were used to compare and analyze the accuracy and speed of the algorithm in solving high dimensionality benchmark functions, respectively. The dimensions used in the test are 30, 100, and 500 dimensions. After that, four algorithms were applied to a real example to optimize the deployment of 5G base stations, including macrobase stations and microbase stations. RWSSA has very good performance in terms of performance and practical application. Therefore, RWSSA is more suitable for the application of 5G base station distribution optimization in open-pit mines. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1229	Facilitating URLLC in UAV-Assisted Relay Systems With Multiple-Mobile Robots for 6G Networks: A Prospective of Agriculture 4.0	In the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is considered as an essential service that will empower real-time wireless systems, smart grids, and industrial applications. In this context, URLLC traffic relies on short blocklength packets to reduce the latency, which poses a daunting challenge for network operators and system designers since classical communication systems are designed based on the classical Shannon's capacity formula. Therefore, to tackle this challenge, this article considers an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acting as a decode-and-forward relay to communicate short URLLC control packets between a controller and multiple-mobile robots in a cell to enable a use-case of Agriculture 4.0. Moreover, this article employs perturbation theory and studies the quasi-optimization of the UAV's location, height, beamwidth, and resource allocation, including time-varying power and blocklength for the two phases of transmission from the controller to UAV and from UAV to robots. In this regard, we propose an iterative optimization method to find the optimal UAV's height and location, the antenna beamwidth, and the variable power and blocklength allocated to each robot inside the circular cell to minimize the average overall decoding error. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms based on fixed parameters and performs nearly as well as the smart exhaustive search. Lastly, our results emphasize the need to jointly optimize all of the abovementioned UAV's system parameters and resource allocation for the two phases of transmission to achieve URLLC for multiple-mobile robots. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	8

1231	A Cloud-Fog Based Adaptive Framework for Optimal Scheduling of Energy Hubs	The energy hub has gained a lot of importance as a way to optimize multicarrier energy infrastructure to enhance its flexibility and proficiency. In the presence of energy storage in energy hubs, it is possible to efficiently coordinate energy supply and demand while taking advantage of changing energy tariffs and local renewable energy supply sources. In this article, we propose a novel method based on gray wolf optimization (GWO), which breaks down the complex optimization problem into subproblems, including the storage scheduling and another part in the grid, and comes up with the respective solutions via GWO and interior point. As a result, the proposed method avoids the drawbacks of numerical ways and artificial intelligence techniques, which tend to converge only to a local minimum or require heavy computational times. Furthermore, the article proposes a multilayer cloud computing framework for optimally scheduling energy hubs. The present study applies the new technique to a two-hub and three-hub system during 24 h. The approach is also examined in the context of an 11-hub system to investigate the efficiency and potential applications. The outcomes prove that the approach can achieve a very near-global point, which is confirmed through an analytical method, as well as being rapid sufficient to permit for online implementations with receding time horizons. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	
1232	Experience-Driven Attack Design and Federated-Learning-Based Intrusion Detection in Industry 4.0	The advent of Industry 4.0 facilitates the Int- ernet-of-Things-based-transactive energy system (IoTES), which enables innovative services with numerous independent distributed systems. These systems generate heterogeneous data in bulk, which become susceptible to cyber-attacks, particularly the stealthy false data injection attacks (FDIAs). The existing centralized FDIA detection algorithms often breach data privacy and fail to perform effectively in highly dynamic and distributed environments, such as IoTES. To resolve the issue, initially, a recurrent deep deterministic policy gradient is utilized to invent an experience-driven FDIA in a complex IoTES. The attacker intends to intelligently exploit the data integrity of smart energy meters with insufficient knowledge of the system. Subsequently, to countermove the stealth and enable independent clients to train a centralized model while keeping each client's data privacy intact, a deep-federated-learning-based decentralized FDIA detection method using an attentive aggregation is exploited in this article. The proposed approach is capable of parallel computing and can reliably identify the stealthy FDIA on all the nodes simultaneously. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under a distributed environment with a significantly higher detection accuracy and lower computational complexity while keeping the data privacy intact. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1233	Compressed Sensing Framework for Heart Sound Acquisition in Internet of Medical Things	For continuous monitoring of cardiovascular diseases, this article presents a novel framework for heart sound acquisition. The proposed approach uses compressed sensing for signal sampling, and a two-stage reconstruction is developed for reconstruction. The first stage aims to give a tentative recovered signal, on which a peak detection technique is developed to identify whether there is a peak in current segment and, if so, its location. With such information, an adaptive dictionary is selected for the second round reconstruction. Because the selected dictionary is adaptive to the morphology of current frame, the signal reconstruction performance is consequently promoted. Experiment results indicate that a satisfactory performance can be obtained when the frame length is 256 and the signal morphology is divided into 16 categories. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compared with a series of counterparts, and the results well demonstrate the advantages of our proposal, especially at high compression ratios. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12

These scenarios present security and privacy issues because of the lack of trust and transparency in the energy markets. In this article, a secure ET system named energy blockchain (EBC) is proposed in order to overcome the security issues. An EBC is suitable for P2P ET situations in which trusted intermediaries are not needed. Similarly, a credit-based payment method to help eliminate ET delays due to transaction confirmation delays on the EBC is proposed. In addition, an optimal pricing method according to the Stackelberg game has been suggested for credit-based loans.

1235	A Subgrid-Oriented Privacy-Preserving Microservice Framework Based on Deep Neural Network for False Data Injection Attack Detection in Smart Grids	False data injection attacks (FDIAs) have recently become a major threat to smart grids. Most of the existing FDIA detection methods have focused on modeling the temporal relationship of time-series measurement data but have paid less attention to the spatial relationship between bus/line measurement data and have failed to consider the relationship between subgrids. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a subgrid-oriented microservice framework by integrating a well-designed spatial-temporal neural network for FDIA detection in ac-model power systems. First, a well-designed neural network is developed to model the spatial-temporal relationship of bus/line measurements for subgrids. A microservice-based supervising network is then proposed for integrating the representation features obtained from subgrids for the collaborative detection of FDIAs. To evaluate the proposed framework, three types of FDIA datasets are generated based on a public benchmark power grid. Case studies on the FDIA datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for FDIA detection in these datasets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	7
1236	A Scalable Protocol Level Approach to Prevent Machine Learning Attacks on Physically Unclonable Function Based Authentication Mechanisms for Internet of Medical Things	The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a revolutionary paradigm, moving toward ubiquity in day-to-day life and used in several applications such as smart healthcare systems, industry 4.0, critical infrastructure, etc. As with any concept that relies on wireless communication, authentication is of paramount importance in regards to security considerations. Devices in many IoT applications are severely constrained in terms of computational resources and are thus unable to utilize many modern cryptographic methods for security purposes. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) propose to solve this issue by allowing devices to generate unique and secure digital fingerprints at extremely low computational cost. However, PUFs are vulnerable to machine learning based modeling attacks that can mathematically clone the PUFs in order to impersonate them. To address these requirements, this article introduces a new lightweight and practical anonymous authentication protocol for IoT that is resilient against machine learning attacks on PUFs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	9

However, despite the valuable healthcare services, this progression raises significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. In this article, we focus our attention on the IEC 60 870-5-104 protocol, which is widely adopted in industrial healthcare systems. First, we investigate and assess the severity of the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks by providing a quantitative threat model, which relies on Attack Defence Trees and Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1. Next, we introduce an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS), which is capable of discriminating and mitigating automatically the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks. The proposed IDPS takes full advantage of the machine learning (ML) and software defined networking (SDN) technologies. ML is used to detect the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks, utilizing 1) Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol network flow statistics and 2) IEC 60 870-5-104 payload flow statistics. On the other side, the automated mitigation is transformed into a multiarmed bandit problem, which is solved through a reinforcement learning method called Thomson sampling and SDN. The evaluation analysis demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed IDPS in terms of intrusion detection accuracy and automated mitigation performance.

1238	Fault Diagnosis of Wheelset Bearings in High-Speed Trains Using Logarithmic Short-Time Fourier Transform and Modified Self-Calibrated Residual Network	Fault diagnosis of wheelset bearings in high-speed trains has attracted constant interest in the scientific community and industrial field. Under the harsh working condition, e.g., time-varying speed and load, most existing methods are hindered by the limited and unknown situations of wheelset bearings. Although the self-calibrated convolution is proven to effectively expand the receptive field with more accurate discriminative regions, its use in fault diagnosis still lacks needed physical interpretation as well as computational efficiency. To this end, this article presents a novel framework by using the logarithmic short-time Fourier transform and the modified self-calibrated convolution. It first manifests a time-frequency map that has explicit physics meaning while reducing the gap between high energy and detailed characteristics in the masking of interfering signals. To simplify redundant kernels, a modified self-calibrated residual block is proposed without introducing any more parameters, while preserving an interpretable and simple structure. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are verified by the experimental data collected from an industrial railway axle bearing test rig. Results are found superior to those of five state-of-art methods, which are more practical in terms of accuracy, cost time, and model size. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

Planar flux sensing coils have been investigated for the defect detection of SCIM rotor. However, these types of sensors cannot accurately evaluate the severity of porosity or broken bar. This article develops a novel instrument to inspect and quantitatively analyze the rotor quality of SCIM. The sensor consists of the electromagnetic flux sensing coils directly from an SCIM stator. By injecting a dc voltage at phases A and B of the sensor, the induced voltage signal is generated from phase C. A quantitative fault indicator (QFI) is constructed on the basis of the instrument voltage output. The variation trend of the QFI with respect to fault severity is investigated by establishing a theoretical sensor model. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can accurately detect the porosity and broken bar, and evaluate their severities for the die cast rotor.

This blockchain requires validators to reach the consensuses. Currently, the validators are chosen based on generic attributes of trusted nodes capriciously. However, service users have no mechanism to provide their requirements in assessing validators.

Federated learning is a learning paradigm that facilitates collaborative learning in a federation of users without exchanging actual data with a single authority like a server. However, federated learning provides only a basic level of privacy and robustness and is vulnerable to model poisoning and model inversion attacks in hostile training environments. Hence, in this article, we propose MediSecFed - a secure framework for federated learning in a hostile environment. Compared to the widely used FedAvg, our method relies on simple and practical ideas from knowledge distillation and model inversion to ensure additional security and privacy features. Our approach achieves knowledge exchange among participating entities without sharing model parameters as FedAvg does, thus protecting the privacy of the local data from the server and significantly reducing communication costs. We evaluate our method on two chest X-ray datasets. Our method outperforms FedAvg by 15% on both datasets in a hostile environment. Our method will also continue to maintain good performance even if the number of malicious participating entities increases. Robustness to learn in a malicious environment while preserving privacy with reduced communication costs makes our method more desirable and efficient than that of FedAvg. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

1253	A Cybertwin-Based 6G Cooperative IoE Communication Network: Secrecy Outage Analysis	The sixth-generation (6G) communication networks being highly data-intensive and enabled by the Internet of Everything (IoE) are envisaged to find applications in various domains including smart healthcare, smart industry, and gaming. In this article, a novel hybrid 6G-based cybertwin cooperative architecture is studied and an analytical framework for the secrecy outage analysis is presented. The base station (BS) considered utilizes nonorthogonal-multiple-access for content request transmission to the cybertwin host and the server with a direct communication link present between the BS and the server. A wireless link experiencing Nakagami-m fading is considered which is further assisted in the communication network by a wired link which is a power line communication link and experiences Rayleigh fading, for the communication between the cybertwin host and the server. Secrecy error probability expressions are derived for the cybertwin host and the server for the scenario when both the wireless and the wired links are available for communication and only the wireless link is available for communication. Furthermore, the presented analytical results are corroborated with simulation results which demonstrate the optimality of operating the wireless links at lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. It is observed that for the lower values of Nakagami fading parameter, better secrecy performance is observed with the usage of wired link along with the wireless link, and also the secrecy performance of the cybertwin host and the server is dependent on the system parameters like the fading parameter and the average SNR. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1254	Symbiosis Between D2D Communication and Industrial IoT for Industry 5.0 in 5G mm-Wave Cellular Network: An Interference Management Approach	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paves way into Industry 5.0, which incorporates human-machine collaboration, thereby making manufacturing industry efficient. As 5G architecture supports massive IoT connectivity and has higher spectrum efficiency, device-to-device (D2D) communication is favorable at 28 GHz. While transmitting data from sensors to end user through IoT network, interference affects the system. Thus, an efficient resource allocation scheme is needed for minimizing interference and increasing data rate. Here, formulated problem is divided into two subproblems, channel assignment and power optimization in order to lower computational complexity. A partial resource multiplexing scheme is proposed that will allocate channels to available D2D users. Later, power optimization problem is formulated which is determined through Lagrangian dual optimization technique. Dynamic sectorization overcomes issue of increase in user traffic.

1255	A Counter-Eavesdropping Technique for Optimized Privacy of Wireless Industrial IoT Communications	The industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) is a key component of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) which is faced with privacy issues as the scale and sensitivity of user and system data constantly increases. Eavesdropping attack is one of such privacy issue of the IIoT system especially when the number of transmitting antennas is increased. Thus, the focus of this article is on establishing efficient privacy in an IIoT-multiple-input-multiple-output-multiple-antenna eavesdropping communications scenario. To achieve this, a closed-form derivation for asymptotic regularized prompt privacy rate is first formulated for IIoT network system. Then, the study further examines the design of optimal jamming parameters by proposing a model referred as optimal counter-eavesdropping channel approximation technique for tackling eavesdropping attack in IIoT. The simulated performance of the proposed model clearly shows that provided that the channel coherence time is less than two times the number of transmitting nodes, a high privacy precision is achieved even without deploying any artificial noise. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
1256	Fast Anomaly Identification Based on Multiaspect Data Streams for Intelligent Intrusion Detection Toward Secure Industry 4.0	Various cyber attacks often occur in logistics network of the Industry 4.0, which poses a threat to Internet security. Intrusion detection can intelligently detect anomalous activities and secure the Internet with the help of anomaly detection algorithms. Different from static data, intrusion detection data are a dynamic data form and have the following characteristics. First, it is multiaspect. Second, it contains point anomalies and group anomalies. Third, there are correlations between different attributes. Nevertheless, these properties pose a challenge on existing anomaly detection approaches. Thus, a novel anomaly detection approach MDS_AD is proposed in this article to deal with the challenges. It combines locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), isolation forest, and PCA techniques. MDS_AD has the following properties. 1) The introduced LSH can operate on multiaspect data. 2) MDS_AD can effectively catch group anomalies from the experimental results. 3) The PCA is utilized to reduce dimensionality for correlations between different attributes. 4) MDS_AD is a streaming approach, which can perform model update and process data in constant memory and time. To confirm the performance of MDS_AD, multiple experiments are designed and implemented on UNSW-NB15 dataset.

1257	A Novel Real-Time Deterministic Scheduling Mechanism in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems for Energy Internet	As an effective distributed renewable energy utilization paradigm, a microgrid is expected to realize the high integration of the industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS), which has attracted extensive attention from academia and industry. However, the real-time interaction and feedback loop between physical systems and cyber systems have posed severe challenges to the reliability, determinacy, and energy efficiency of the multiway flow of information and communication transmission. In order to solve the problem of slot scheduling and data transmission (SSDT) in the microgrid, a novel real-time deterministic scheduling (RTDS) scheme for industrial CPS is proposed in this article. First, the SSDT is formulated as a multiway flow scheduling problem, and it is theoretically proved that the SSDT problem is NP-hard. Then, the RTDS scheme designs two heuristic algorithms: scheduling request preprocessing and greedy-based multichannel time slot allocation for an optimal scheduling solution. Practical experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RTDS scheme has significant advantages in packet loss rate, deadline guarantee rate, and energy consumption compared with the traditional schemes, and thus, is more suitable for deployment in microgrid systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	23
1258	Secure User Authentication Leveraging Keystroke Dynamics via Wi-Fi Sensing	User authentication plays a critical role in access control of a man-machine system, where the knowledge factor, such as a personal identification number, constitutes the most widely used authentication element. However, knowledge factors are usually vulnerable to the spoofing attack. Recently, the inheritance factor, such as fingerprints, emerges as an efficient alternative resilient to malicious users, but it normally requires special equipment. To this end, in this article, we propose WiPass, a device-free authentication system only leveraging the pervasive Wi-Fi infrastructure to explore keystroke dynamics (manner and rhythm of keystrokes) captured by the channel state information to recognize legitimate users while rejecting spoofers. However, it remains an open challenge to characterize the behavioral features hidden in the human subtle motions, such as keystrokes. Therefore, we build a signal enhancement model using Ricean distribution to amplify user keystroke dynamics and a hybrid learning model for user authentication, which consists of two parts, i.e., convolutional neural network based feature extraction and support vector machine based classification. The former relies on visualizing the channel responses into time-series images to learn the behavioral features of keystrokes in energy and spectrum domains, whereas the latter exploits such behavioral features for user authentication. We prototype WiPass on the low-cost off-The-shelf Wi-Fi devices and verify its performance. Empirical results show that WiPass achieves on average 92.1% authentication accuracy, 5.9% false accept rate, and 6.3% false reject rate in three real environments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3

Then, we formulate the authentication problem into a signature transitivity problem by incorporating accumulator knowledge and a standard digital signature scheme. As a consequence, the legality of authentication is well-verified by computing the signature and witness of the related edges without worrying about whether the devices belong to the same administrative domain or not. Finally, the efficiency and online time of authority are solved by exploring the blockchain technology, which also leads to the assurance of an online 24-hour third party.

Data outsourcing is one of the ways to manage the overhead of the massive data generated from the various resource-constrained devices utilized in the industrial environment. Therefore, the crowdsourced data from many organizations are outsourced to the cloud system.

In this article, one of the recent MCDM weighting methods called fuzzy weighted with zero inconsistency (FWZIC) is effective for weighting the evaluation criteria subjectively without any inconsistency issues. However, considering the advantages of spherical fuzzy sets in providing a wide range of options to decision-makers and efficiently dealing with vagueness, hesitancy and uncertainty, this article formulated a new version of FWZIC for weighting the security and privacy properties, that is, spherical FWZIC (S-FWZIC). Moreover, an integrated MCDM framework was developed for benchmarking blockchain-based IoT healthcare Industry 4.0 systems on the basis of multi security and privacy properties. In the first phase of the methodology, a decision matrix is formulated based on the intersection of 'blockchain-based Internet of Things healthcare Industry 4.0 systems' and 'security and privacy properties' (i.e., user authentication, access control, privacy protection, integrity availability and anonymity). In the second phase, the weights of each security and privacy property are calculated through the S-FWZIC method. Then, these weights are employed to benchmark blockchain-based IoT healthcare Industry 4.0 systems through the combined grey relational analysis-technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (GRA-TOPSIS) and the bald eagle search (BES) optimization method. Results indicate the following: First, the S-FWZIC method efficiently weighs the security and privacy properties, indicating that access control has the highest significance weight of 0.2070, while integrity has the lowest weight (0.0646); and second, the combination of the GRA-TOPSIS and the BES optimization method effectively ranks the systems. The evaluation was conducted using sensitivity analysis, revealing high correlation results over all the discussed scenarios of changing the weights of the criteria.

Thus, designing secure and efficient communication channels is always a research hotspot. However, end devices have memory, computation, and power-supplying capacities limitations. Moreover, perfect forward secrecy (PFS), which means that long-term key exposure still discloses previous session keys, is a critical security property for authentication and key exchange (AKE). This article proposes an AKE protocol named SAKE∗ for the IIoT environment, where two types of keys (i.e., a master key and an evolution key) guarantee PFS. In addition, the SAKE∗ protocol merely uses concatenation, XOR, and hash-function operations to achieve lightweight authentication, key exchange, and message integrity. We also compare the SAKE∗ protocol with seven current and IoT-related authentication protocols regarding security properties and performance. Comparison results indicate that the SAKE∗ protocol consumes the least computation resource and third-least communication cost among eight AKE protocols while equipping 12 security properties. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

1280	Protecting Location Privacy of Users Based on Trajectory Obfuscation in Mobile Crowdsensing	In mobile crowdsensing activities, it is usually necessary for participants to upload sensing data and related locations. The existing location privacy-preserving mechanisms cannot well protect a user's trajectory privacy because attackers can mine the user's trajectory features through data analysis techniques. Aiming at the trajectory privacy protection problem, this article proposes a differential location privacy-preserving mechanism based on trajectory obfuscation (LPMT). LPMT first extracts the stay points as the features of a trajectory based on the sliding window algorithm, and then obfuscates each stay point to a target obfuscation subregion through the exponential mechanism, and finally performs the Laplace sampling in the target obfuscation subregion to obtain the obfuscated GPS points. Compared with the baseline mechanisms, LPMT can reduce data quality loss by more than 20% while providing the same level of obfuscation quality, which indicates that LPMT has the advantages of strong security and high quality of service. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1281	SDMTA: Attack Detection and Mitigation Mechanism for DDoS Vulnerabilities in Hybrid Cloud Environment	In a distributed cloud context, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are widespread. The services are rendered unavailable to legitimate users as a result of the overwhelming traffic, resulting in financial losses. There are possible obstacles, although several researchers have established various mitigation measures. Initially, Software-defined networking technology was revealed to protect businesses from DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks cause server outages and financial losses due to service unavailability. Meeting of service-level agreement with the customers remains a challenge. In this article, the scattered denial-of-service mitigation tree architecture (SDMTA) is used to propose a novel DDoS mitigation strategy for the hybrid cloud environment. To enable detection procedures, the proposed SDMTA mitigation architecture includes integrated network monitoring. The suggested and existing state-of-the-art models' detection rates over the input dataset were estimated. When compared to the existing state-of-the-art model, the system's accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity were found to be 99.7%, 98.32%, and 99.92%, respectively. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1282	Decentralized Wireless Federated Learning with Differential Privacy	This article studies decentralized federated learning algorithms in wireless IoT networks. The traditional parameter server architecture for federated learning faces some problems such as low fault tolerance, large communication overhead and inaccessibility of private data. To solve these problems, we propose a decentralized wireless federated learning algorithm called DWFL. The algorithm works in a system where the workers are organized in a peer-to-peer and server-less manner, and the workers exchange their privacy preserving data with the analog transmission scheme over wireless channels in parallel. With rigorous analysis, we show that DWFL satisfies (δ)-differential privacy and the privacy budget per worker scales as O 1N), in contrast with the constant budget in the orthogonal transmission approach. Furthermore, DWFL converges at the same rate of O( 1 TN) as the best known centralized algorithm with a central parameter server. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm DWFL also performs well in real settings. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1283	A Novel Resource Oriented DMA Framework for Internet of Medical Things Devices in 5G Network	The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) mobile devices such as ambulance, medical done, and emergency mobile medical equipment face severe signal distortions due to interference, end-to-end packet loss, handoff delays, and lower throughputs during mobility. Network mobility basic support protocol (NBSP) has been proposed using the IP-based Wi-Fi solution to solve these issues. However, the weak signal, extra signaling overhead, and higherdelays were identified during handover due to patients' excessive requisites, resulting in radio link failure.

1284	An Improved Hybrid Swarm Intelligence for Scheduling IoT Application Tasks in the Cloud	The usage of cloud services is growing exponentially with the recent advancement of Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications. Advanced scheduling approaches are needed to successfully meet the application demands while harnessing cloud computing's potential effectively to schedule the IoT services onto cloud resources optimally. This article proposes an alternative task scheduler approach for organizing IoT application tasks over the CCE. In particular, a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method, using a modified Manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) and the salp swarm algorithm (SSA), is proposed to handle the problem of scheduling IoT tasks in cloud computing. This proposed method, called MRFOSSA, depends on using SSA to improve the local search ability of MRFO that typically enhances the rate of convergence towards the global solution. To validate the developed MRFOSSA, a set of experimental series is performed using different real-world and synthetic datasets with variant sizes. The performance of MRFOSSA is tested and compared with other metaheuristic techniques. Experiment results show the superiority of MRFOSSA over its competitors in terms of performance measures, such as makespan time and cloud throughput. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	14
1285	Mitigating the Backdoor Attack by Federated Filters for Industrial IoT Applications	The federated learning provides an effective solution to train collaborative models over a large scale of participated Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications with the help of a global server, building an intelligent life. However, the federated learning is vulnerable to the backdoor attack from strong malicious participants. The backdoor attack is inconspicuous and may result in devastating consequences.

We build multiple filters with eXplainable AI models on the server and send them to clients randomly, preventing advanced attackers from evading the defense. Our backdoor filters show significant backdoor recognition with the accuracy up to 99%. After the implementation of the blur-label-flipping strategy, victim's local model on suspicious backdoor samples can achieve the accuracy up to 88%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

In view of these difficulties, in this article, we use the advantages of edge computing and federated learning, combined with the outstanding characteristics of the blockchain, to propose a secure data transmission method. First, we separate the local model updating process from the mobile device independent process; second, we add an edge server so that most of the computation is carried out on the server, which improves the learning efficiency; and finally, we use a distributed architecture of the blockchain to protect data security and privacy. Extensive simulation experiments show that the accuracy of our model can reach 98%. In addition, BC-EdgeFLs interception rate of illegal information can reach 0.8, which has good defensive capabilities.

1287	Intermediate Distribution Alignment and Its Application into Mechanical Fault Transfer Diagnosis	Domain adaptation has been widely used for knowledge transfer. However, the aligning targets of the existing domain adaptation mechanisms dynamically vary during the training, which leads to the loss oscillation, slow convergence, and poor robustness. To overcome this main problem, a novel domain adaptation mechanism named intermediate distribution alignment (IDA) is proposed. For implementing the end-to-end diagnostic tasks, a feature extractor based on deep convolutional neural network with wide first-layer kernel is first built to fit the posterior distributions of source and target domains. Then through the KL divergence, IDA maps the learned features from the source and target domains into a specific intermediate distribution. It is proved theoretically that IDA can align the prior distributions of two domains. The proposed IDA mechanism is successfully applied to the fault transfer diagnosis of planetary gearboxes without labeled target-domain samples. The comparative results show that the proposed IDA mechanism has higher diagnostic performance than the typical domain adaptation mechanisms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1288	A Secure Cloudlet-Based Charging Station Recommendation for Electric Vehicles Empowered by Federated Learning	The fast-growing electric vehicles (EVs) industry requires a well-designed recommendation system to locate charging stations while ensuring private data protection. This article proposes a secure cloudlet-based recommendation system for EVs. Unlike conventional methods where training a recommender model involves direct data sharing between data holders, our model utilizes a secure vertical federated learning technique, in which EVs data do not leave the platforms. To improve the efficiency of the model and to alleviate the communication-related concerns in our recommender model, cloudlet-based data aggregator(s) are used as a replacement for the existing centralized architectures. To enhance the security of our system, blockchain technology is incorporated to generate a trusted network of cloudlets that are responsible for transmitting the locally computed training parameters. The simulation results achieved from our proposed recommendation system show that the distribution of EVs over a designated area with charging stations is more optimal, and the proposed decentralized recommender with 10 cloudlets is 5.2 s quicker than a conventional centralized model. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1289	A Novel Model Based on Window-Pass Preferences for Data Emergency Aware Scheduling in Computer Networks	The breakdown of vital communication infrastructures is one of the most common characteristics of all disasters. It can cause severe communication problems such as time delays and data loss, which cause deterioration in system performance. New techniques are needed to cope with such situations, many of which have been made possible due to the ongoing evolution of artificial intelligence technologies. In this study, we consider the case of a network consisting of several router allocation problems in situations of high priority and emergency data allocation. A novel network component called the scheduler is introduced and window constraints for routers are imposed. To solve the studied problem, four different algorithms are developed in this work. These algorithms were then applied in a particular scenario consisting of several routers and 2200 instances. In terms of the gap and running time, the proposed algorithms provide acceptable results. The best performances were achieved using the critical packet algorithm for 80% of instances with an average gap value of 0.009 and an average time of 0.209 s. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	11

These devices are typically interconnected by CAN, which is still the most important in-vehicle network. Precise clock synchronization over CAN is difficult due to the properties of the bus, and current approaches often use dedicated hardware or proprietary software solutions. A few years ago, however, the AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR) development alliance published a standardized synchronization method. In this article, we investigate what synchronization precision can be realistically achieved in a real-world automotive hardware and software environment. This involves pure software timestamping, standard CAN controllers without hardware modifications, and a typical automotive real-time operating system. We evaluate several approaches to reduce the synchronization jitter using filtering and optimizing the timestamping procedure. Experiments show that, ultimately, a precision better than 50 μs can be achieved with a fully AUTOSAR-compliant software implementation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1291	SecureIIoT Environment: Federated Learning Empowered Approach for Securing IIoT from Data Breach	The growing congruence of gadgets today resulted in a numerous type of cyber attacks.

1293	Recursive Hybrid Variable Monitoring for Fault Detection in Nonstationary Industrial Processes	Practical industrial processes usually have nonstationary properties, which make the monitoring more challenging because the fault information may be buried by nonstationary trends. For nonstationary processes, many methods have been proposed for fault detection based on continuous variables. However, binary variables may appear together with continuous variables in modern industrial processes. To address the issue of process monitoring with hybrid variables and nonstationarity, a model named recursive hybrid variable monitoring (RHVM) is proposed in this paper. For RHVM, recursive strategy is utilized to suppress nonstationary trend and to reveal fault information. In addition, RHVM has the ability of model self-updating with arriving samples. The closed-form updates of required parameters are derived in detail and the improvement of performance is analyzed. At last, the superiority of the proposed model is demonstrated by a simulation example and a practical nonstationary process of a power plant. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1294	Efficient Flow Scheduling for Industrial Time-Sensitive Networking: A Divisibility Theory-Based Method	As an emerging communication technology, time-sensitive networking (TSN) promises the real time and deterministic interaction of massive data in Industrial Internet of Things. However, it is challenging to schedule the time-sensitive flows timely and superiorly through the mechanism analysis for current TSN scheduling models, especially in complex industrial scenarios. In this article, we propose an analysis approach of flow sequences based on divisibility theory to characterize the flow conflicts and dependencies, which derives the scheduling flexibility based on flow position diversity (PD) and the equivalent flow judgment conditions for slot occupancy. Integrating the abovementioned derivation, a parallel computing framework with the generalized slot length is established to lower the scheduling complexity. Within each computing unit, an incremental scheduling algorithm with the flow judgment conditions and PD-based search boundary is proposed. It reduces the scheduling complexity further while maintaining load balance for the mixed transmission of periodic and aperiodic flows. To achieve the optimality of runtime and load balance, two PD-based flow sorting strategies are designed, respectively. The evaluation results show that compared with the existing works, the runtime efficiency of scheduling at scale is increased by at least 1500 times in complex traffic scenarios while the load balance on the network links is also improved. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

Particularly, IoT botnet has been emerging as the most urgent issue in IoT security. The main approaches for IoT botnet detection are static, dynamic, and hybrid analysis. Static analysis is the process of parsing files without executing them, while dynamic analysis, in contrast, executes them in a controlled and monitored environment (i.e., sandbox, simulator, and emulator) to record system's changes for further investigation. In this article, we present a novel and advanced method for IoT botnet detection using dynamic analysis to improve graph-based features, which are generated based on static analysis. Specifically, dynamic analysis is used to collect printable string information that appears during the execution of the samples. Then, we use the printable string information to traverse the graph, which is obtained based on the static analysis, effectively, and ultimately acquiring graph-based features that can distinguish benign and malicious samples. In order to estimate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed hybrid approach, we conduct the experiment on a dataset of 8330 executable samples, including 5531 IoT botnet samples and 2799 IoT benign samples. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 98.1% and 91.99% for detecting and classifying IoT botnet, respectively. These results show that our approach has outperformed other existing contemporary counterpart methods in the aspects of accuracy and complexity. In addition, our experiments also demonstrate that hybrid graph-based features for IoT botnet family classification can further improve static or dynamic features' performance individually. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

However, designing an optimal dynamic radio resource allocation to handle the fluctuating traffic loads is critical. In this article, a novel architectural design of an SDN-based virtual Fog-RAN is proposed, in which we jointly study radio resource allocation and transmit beamforming to improve resource utilization and IIoT users' satisfaction, by minimizing the network power consumption (NPC) and maximizing the achievable sum-rate (ASR), simultaneously. To this end, we first formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear problem to optimize the physical resource block allocation, the assignment of user equipments, and radio unit, and the downlink transmit beamforming, by considering imperfect channel state information. To solve the ntractable MINLP, we exploit the successive convex approximation approach. Then, we formulate a multiple knapsack problem (MKP) to optimize the assignment between RUs and virtual baseband units, by exploiting the set of active RUs minimized in the previous problem. We solve the formulated MKP by decomposing the dual problems and solving them through the dual descent method. Through performance analysis, we show the proposed approach provides a high users' satisfaction rate, maximizes the ASR and minimizes the NPC, and provides better savings, in terms of the number of radio and baseband resources utilized, than its counterparts. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4

To ensure the continuity and robustness of industrial IoT communications in the case of damaged infrastructure communication facilities postdisaster, the industrial IoT can be connected with satellite networks in emergencies. This article presents a cross-regional, end-to-end, transmission control scheme for satellite-supported, multihop industrial IoT. The proposed scheme adjusts the window of data transmission from two phases, slow start and congestion avoidance, to accommodate the low-transmission performance caused by a long delay and high bit error rate in converged networks. The window of data transmission is also adjusted to increase the amount of data transmission for the slow start to fill the high bandwidth-delay product of the converged network, while adjusting the threshold of data transmission based on feedback information to distinguish different data losses during congestion avoidance. The feasibility of the heterogeneous network transmission model is experimentally verified. The results show that the scheme can achieve good performance in heterogeneous networks of industrial IoT and satellite networks.

1303	Deep Reinforcement Learning for Securing Software-Defined Industrial Networks With Distributed Control Plane	The development of software-defined industrial networks (SDIN) promotes the programmability and customizability of the industrial networks and is suitable to cope with the challenges brought by new manufacturing modes. For building more scalable and reliable SDIN, a distributed control plane with multicontroller collaboration becomes a promising option. However, as the brain of SDIN, the security of the distributed control plane is rarely considered. In addition to suffering direct attacks, each controller is also subjected to attacks propagated by other controllers because of information sharing or management domain takeover, resulting in the spread of attacks in a wider range than a single controller. Therefore, in this article, we study attacks against SDIN with distributed control plane, demonstrate their propagation across multiple controllers, and analyze their impacts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the security of SDIN with distributed control plane. In addition, since the existing defense mechanisms are not specifically designed for distributed SDIN and cannot defend it perfectly, we propose an attack mitigation scheme based on deep reinforcement learning to adaptively prevent the spread of attacks. Specifically, the novelty of our scheme lies in its ability of learning from the environment and flexibly adjusting the switch takeover decisions to isolate the attack source, so as to tolerate attacks and enhance the resilience of SDIN. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

Similar to software defined networks (SDN), SDIN suffers from low traffic scheduling efficiency caused by large and imbalanced flows, known as the heavy hitters problem. Due to such heavy hitters, industrial networks may fail to satisfy application's QoS requirements, which results in more severe damages. To improve flow scheduling efficiency under heavy hitters, this article introduces a novel imitation learning-based flow scheduling (ILFS) method. ILFS utilizes P4-based In-band Network Telemetry (INT) to collect fine-grained, real-time traffic data from SDIN's data plane. In the control plane, it integrates the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) model with a soft actor critic to preserve the experiences of flow, thereby better scheduling large flows.

These domains include smart home, smart farming, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Among these territories, the IIoT obtains more attention. In an IIoT environment, a legitimate user can control and access devices remotely. Legitimate users can access real-time data and share confidential information. The information is transmitted via public communication channel, which can be vulnerable to security attacks. In this article, we present a provably secure multifactor authenticated key agreement scheme to offer security regarding transmission of data in IIoT environment. This scheme will support the legitimate user to remotely access the sensing devices. Our presented scheme uses only symmetric cryptographic, bitwise XOR operation, and hash function to be resource-constrained. Our scheme is found to be resource efficient through communication and computation analysis. The performance analysis illustrates that the cost of computation and communication of our scheme is comparatively low as compared to other relevant schemes. The formal and informal security analysis proved that our scheme is secure and efficient as it can withstand several known adversarial attacks.

1306	Adversarial Regressive Domain Adaptation Approach for Infrared Thermography-Based Unsupervised Remaining Useful Life Prediction	Infrared thermography provides abundant spatiotemporal degradation information, facilitating non-contact condition monitoring. Reducing domain shift between simulated and industrial infrared images is significantly desired for leveraging labeled simulated data to tackle practical insufficiency of run-to-failure samples. Recently, adversarial-based domain adaptation (DA) techniques have aroused broad concern in solving domain shifts. However, simultaneously aligning marginal and conditional distributions in cross-domain remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is rarely researched in adversarial-based DA. In this article, an adversarial regressive domain adaptation (ARDA) approach is, thus, put forward to address this challenge. First, a regressive disparity discrepancy is designed to describe the dissimilarity between distributions and derive the generalization bound for cross-domain prognostics. Guided by this bound, the ARDA effectively aligns marginal and conditional distributions by learning indistinguishable features and considering the relationship between samples and prediction tasks. Simulated and experimental infrared degradation image datasets are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods for cross-domain RUL prediction. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1307	A Bayesian Deep Learning Framework for RUL Prediction Incorporating Uncertainty Quantification and Calibration	In this article, deep learning (DL) has attracted increasing attention for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. However, most DL-based prognostics methods only provide deterministic RUL values while ignoring the associated epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. In practice, it is important to know the exact confidence in model predictions for decision making. In this article, a Bayesian deep learning (BDL) framework for RUL prediction incorporating uncertainty quantification and calibration is proposed. First, the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, which account for the ignorance about the model and the noise inherent in the observations, respectively, are characterized by integrating both types of uncertainties into a BDL framework. Second, to avoid under-and over-confident predictions, a novel iterative calibration method is proposed to jointly calibrate epistemic, aleatoric, and predictive uncertainties by combining isotonic regression with standard deviation scaling. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the case study of turbofan engines and lithium-ion batteries datasets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1308	Personalized Privacy-Aware Task Offloading for Edge-Cloud-Assisted Industrial Internet of Things in Automated Manufacturing	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices are widely used for monitoring and controlling the process of automated manufacturing. Owing to the limited computing capacity of the IIoT sensors in the production line, the scheduling task in the production line needs to be offloaded to the edge computing server (ECS). To obtain the desired quality of service (QoS) during offloading scheduling tasks, the precise interaction information between the production line and ECSs has to be uploaded to the cloud platform, which poses privacy issues. The existing works mostly assume that all the interaction information, i.e., the offloading decision for the subtask in a scheduling task, has same privacy level, which cannot meet the various privacy requirements of the offloading decision for the subtask. Hence, we propose a local-differential-privacy-based deep reinforcement learning (LDP-DRL) approach in the edge-cloud-assisted IIoT to provide personalized privacy guarantee. The LDP mechanism can generate different levels of noise to satisfy the various privacy requirements of the offloading decision for the subtask. The prioritized experience replay is integrated in DRL to reduce the impact of noise on the QoS performance of task offloading. The formal analysis of LDP-DRL is provided in terms of privacy level and convergence. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness, the capacity of privacy protection, the impact of discount factor on the convergence, and the cost efficiency of the LDP-DRL approach. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1309	Knowledge Sharing Enabled Multirobot Collaboration for Preventive Maintenance in Mixed Model Assembly	Intelligent equipment and flexible production lines are at the cores of smart manufacturing. Meanwhile, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence have provided new solutions for the intelligent equipment management and maintenance in mixed model assembly (MMA). This article focuses on knowledge-driven techniques, and it proposes a knowledge sharing-enabled multirobot collaboration (KS-enabled MRC) strategy for preventive maintenance of robots in MMA. First, a formal semantic environment for MMA is constructed by way of ontology-enabled semantic modeling. Then,task-related action primitives and ontology-based robot skill bases are established according to robot capability and task environment. Finally, the Wu-Palmer similarity metric and first-order logic are leveraged to match and reason new tasks according to the semantic rules, and a knowledge sharing and update mechanism are developed for this application. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed KS-enabled MRC can reduce unscheduled downtime and assist in achieving a load balance for robots in MMA. The studied MRC can potentially avoid severe equipment degradation, thus acting as a preventive maintenance paradigm of complex equipment. Furthermore, it is applicable across different platforms and exhibits high deployment efficiency without intense programming requirements. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1310	An Industry-4.0-Complaint Sustainable Bitcoin Model Through Optimized Transaction Selection and Sustainable Block Integration	Cryptocurrencies are the new form of trade that has revolutionized how we look into our financial institutions. Bitcoin dominates the industry with the highest market share among the hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. However, high energy consumption leading to increasing carbon emission, prioritizing high-value transactions, and long waiting times are some of the flaws preventing it from reaching its full potential. Owing to the block rewards getting halved every four years, miners and researchers are fearful that this would be the breaking point of Bitcoin's success. This article proposes an Industry-4.0-compliant next-generation Bitcoin architecture by introducing a dynamic and sustainable block concept. Along with our modified knapsack algorithms, i.e., priority-based 0/1 knapsack and advanced-priority-based 0/1 knapsack, we can ensure a balanced transaction selection, quicker verification, higher transaction throughput, reduced carbon emission, and increased earnings for the miners. Moreover, with the addition of only one of our proposed sustainable blocks, we can cut down verification times by 50% and increase throughput by 39%. We can also reduce carbon emissions per transaction by 61.3%, which would help reduce Bitcoins' large carbon footprint, enabling us to approach greener digital transactions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1311	A Multiwatermarking Scheme for Verifying Medical Image Integrity and Authenticity in the Internet of Medical Things	With the advent of a fifth-generation mobile network and developments in technologies such as the Internet of Medical Things, smart healthcare systems are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives.

In this study, a multiwatermarking scheme is proposed for medical images based on quantum random walk and the brain storm optimization algorithm. A logo image used to verify medical image integrity is embedded in regions of interest, and text data are embedded in regions of non-interest to conceal private hospital and patient information. This process improves the accuracy of medical image verification and helps to ensure authenticity.

1312	Permissioned Blockchain and Deep Learning for Secure and Efficient Data Sharing in Industrial Healthcare Systems	The industrial healthcaresystem has enabled the possibility of realizing advanced real-time monitoring of patients and enriched the quality of medical services through data sharing among intelligent wearable devices and sensors. However, this connectivity brings the intrinsic vulnerabilities related to security and privacy due to the need of continuous communication and monitoring over public network (insecure channel). Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, we integrate permissioned blockchain and smart contract with deep learning (DL) techniques to design a novel secure and efficient data sharing framework named PBDL. Specifically, PBDL first has a blockchain scheme to register, verify (using zero-knowledge proof), and validate the communicating entities using the smart contract-based consensus mechanism. Second, the authenticated data are used to propose a novel DL scheme that combines stacked sparse variational autoencoder (SSVAE) with self-attention-based bidirectional long short term memory (SA-BiLSTM). In this scheme, SSVAE encodes or transforms the healthcare data into new format, and SA-BiLSTM identifies and improves the attack detection process. The security analysis and experimental results using IoT-Botnet and ToN-IoT datasets confirm the superiority of the PBDL framework over existing state-of-the-art techniques. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	6
1313	DCA-IoMT: Knowledge-Graph-Embedding-Enhanced Deep Collaborative Alert Recommendation Against COVID-19	Filtration to optimal exactness is mandatory since the options inundate the online world. Knowledge graph embedding is extraordinarily contributing to the recommendations, but the existing knowledge graph (KG)-based recommendation methods only exploit the correlations among the preferences and stand-alone entities, without bonding the cocurricular features and tendencies of the context. Additionally, the integration of the location-based current data of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into the KG is necessary for the recommendation of region-aware precautionary alerts to the concerned people - an essential application of the current and future Internet of Medical Things. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel deep collaborative alert recommendation (DCA) approach to cope with the situation. Particularly, DCA collects current online data about COVID-19, purifies, and transforms them to the KG. Furthermore, it independently encapsulates the cocurricular features and tendencies of the context in the embedding space and encodes them to the independent hidden factors via a graph neural network. The bi-end hidden factors are computed via matrix factorization to infer the potential connections. Moreover, a relevance estimator and a cross transistor are configured to enhance the generalization capability of the model. Experiments on two real-world datasets are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of DCA. Results and analysis show that the proposed approach has outperformed the baseline methods with fine improvements in providing the required recommendations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1314	A Coordinated Restoration Method of Hybrid AC-DC Distribution Network With Electric Buses Considering Transportation System Influence	The postdisaster restoration capabilities for critical loads in distribution networks need to be enhanced. In recent years, electric buses (EBs) have been widely used with the carbon-neutral target, which can be dispatched and discharged for load restoration considering their mobility and the V2G technology. However, the restoration capabilities of EBs are limited by the transportation system while the ac distribution network can hardly achieve power transfer between lines due to the radial constraint. In this article, a coordinated restoration method of hybrid ac-dc distribution network with EBs is proposed, which has flexible power transfer capability. The control modes of voltage source converters (VSCs) during the postdisaster period as well as the EB restoration capability considering transportation system constraints are analyzed in detail. Then, a bilevel programming model is developed to optimize the network reconfiguration, VSC outputs, and the proposed EBs dispatching scheme simultaneously, in order to achieve a better power transfer capability for load restoration considering their coordination. Simulation studies are performed to verify the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1315	A Blockchain-Empowered Cluster-Based Federated Learning Model for Blade Icing Estimation on IoT-Enabled Wind Turbine	Wind energy is a fast-growing renewable energy but faces blade icing. Data-driven methods provide talented solutions for blade icing detection, but a considerable amount of Internet of Things data needs to be collected to a central server, which may lead to the leakage of sensitive business data. To address this limitation, this article proposes BLADE, a Blockchain-empowered imbalanced federated learning (FL) model for blade icing detection. With the help of the Blockchain, the conventional FL is improved without worrying about the failure of the single centralized server and boosts the privacy preserving.

1316	Cloud-Edge Collaborative Method for Industrial Process Monitoring Based on Error-Triggered Dictionary Learning	The development of cloud manufacturing enables data-driven process monitoring methods to reflect the real industrial process states accurately and timely. However, traditional process monitoring methods cannot update learned models once they are deployed to edge devices, which leads to model mismatch when confronted time-varying data. In addition, limited resources on the edge prevent it from deploying complex models. Therefore, this article proposes a novel cloud-edge collaborative process monitoring method. First, historical data of industrial processes are collected to establish a dictionary learning model and train the dictionary and classifier in the cloud. Then, the model is simplified and deployed to the edge. The edge layer monitors the process states, including fault detection and working condition recognition, and determines whether a model mismatch has occurred based on an error-triggered strategy. Both numerical simulation and industrial roasting process results verify the superiority of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5
1317	Online Battery Protective Energy Management for Energy-Transportation Nexus	Grid-connected electric vehicles (GEVs) and energy-transportation nexus bring a bright prospect to improve the penetration of renewable energy and the economy of microgrids (MGs). However, it is challenging to determine optimal vehicle-to-grid (V2G) strategies due to the complex battery aging mechanism and volatile MG states. This article develops a novel online battery anti-aging energy management method for energy-transportation nexus by using a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Based on battery aging characteristic analysis and rain-flow cycle counting technology, the quantification of aging cost in V2G strategies is realized by modeling the impact of number of cycles, depth of discharge, and charge and discharge rate. The established life loss model is used to evaluate battery anti-aging effectiveness of agent actions. The coordination of GEVs charging is modeled as multiobjective learning by using a DRL algorithm. The training objective is to maximize renewable penetration while reducing MG power fluctuations and vehicle battery aging costs. The developed energy-transportation nexus energy management method is verified to be effective in optimal power balancing and battery anti-aging control on a MG in the U.K. This article provides an efficient and economical tool for MG power balancing by optimally coordinating GEVs charging and renewable energy, thus helping promote a low-cost decarbonization transition. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1318	Dynamic Voltage Unbalance Constrained Economic Dispatch for Electrified Railways Integrated Energy Storage	The cophase traction power supply system (CTPSS) is a promising solution in the smart electrified railways to effectively eliminate the neutral section, improve regeneration braking energy (RBE) utilization and mitigate voltage unbalance (VU). It works by coordinating the power flow distribution (PFD) among the energy storage (ES), power flow controller, and traction transformer. However, the conventional dispatch considering VU mitigation may result in increasing extra operation costs and accelerating ES aging. Therefore, driven by the day-ahead forecasted information, a dynamic VU regulation strategy is proposed to draw up the VU compensation schedule (VU-CS), which can satisfy the probabilistic limitations of power quality standards. Consequently, a Copula-based VU dependence model is developed to transform the VU-CS into the PFD constraint set of CTPSS. Meanwhile, an ES degradation model is introduced to quantify the system operation cost within different scenarios. Taking the PFD as a VU regulation constraint, an economic dispatch scheme of CTPSS is established to obtain a minimum operation cost and maximum RBE utilization. Finally, case study tests verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. The results show that scheme can improve ES cycle life and decrease cost under the probabilistic limitations of VU. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud technologies together with recent advances in machine learning offered various cloud-based data-driven approaches to automatic anomaly detection. However, the challenges introduced by the different types of equipment in rail transit systems with highly diverse data distributions and the lack of labeled anomaly data have not been sufficiently addressed. In this article, we attempt to cope with such challenges by proposing an improved long short term memory (LSTM)-based time-series anomaly detection scheme. The key elements of the proposed scheme include an improved LSTM model that may achieve more accurate time-series prediction for various rail transit devices and a method for determining an appropriate error threshold for detecting anomalies based on the prediction errors. In order to further enhance anomaly detection performance, we also propose a pruning algorithm for reducing the number of false anomalies. Our method does not rely on scarce anomaly labels but dynamically determines a threshold of prediction errors to identify anomalies; therefore, it overcomes the challenge of the extremely uneven distribution of rail transit data. We conducted extensive experiments in a real metro operation environment for performance evaluation. The experiment results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and show a superior performance of the scheme compared to existing anomaly detection methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5

Thus, video analytics become highly demanded, especially for low-latency and high-accuracy analytic results. Yet, the data volume produced by camera clusters is prohibitively high. In this article, we propose Respire, a system that can remove redundant frames for reducing the cost of transmission and processing based on edge computing nodes, while maintaining useful frames for high analytic accuracy. Specifically, Respire incorporates a new way for characterizing the spatial-temporal redundancy between frames. Then, Respire prioritizes the uploading of frames for redundancy reduction. As the search space of the entire collected frames is exponential for the set of frames containing the maximal information, we jointly consider offline and online pruning of frames and propose a heuristic algorithm to reduce the search space. Extensive real-world dataset-based experiments demonstrate that the proposed system can significantly reduce communication and computation costs, while providing sufficient information for guaranteed video analytic accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

Data collection, processing, analysis, task execution, and other devices that can product network traffic volume are gradually being deployed to IIoT. However, under the limited spectrum resources and low-cost and low-energy production requirements of enterprises, how to ensure the interconnection and intercommunication of industrial networks while realizing the effective use of network communication resources is currently a hot topic. Among them, network traffic prediction is considered to be a very important task. The time variability and interpretability, especially the time-varying features of traffic sequences, greatly challenge this task. To address those, this article proposes a method called Flow2graph to predict network traffic in IIoT. Specifically, some key segments, i.e., shapelets are extracted from the network traffic sequence according to time-varying traffic; then uses the relationship between the traffic sequence and shapelets to convert the flow into a shapelets conversion graph; Subsequently, the graph isomorphism network are used to learn the specificity of the flow sequence from different devices, thereby to predict its traffic value for a period of time in the future; finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

Because of rising prices, people in various countries cannot afford nutritious food or proper treatment. Sometimes shops, restaurants, and transportation service providers charge more than the prescribed product price from buyers.

However, the performance of blockchain cannot meet the requirement of massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the important bottlenecks of blockchain is the limited computing resources on a single server while executing transactions. To address this issue, we propose Aeolus blockchain to achieve the distributed execution of blockchain transactions. There are two key challenges to achieving this for IoT blockchain: transaction structure and state consistency. Facing these challenges, we first propose a distributed blockchain transaction structure, which imports extra parameters to divide the transaction execution into different stages to enable distributed execution. Second, we propose distributed state update sharding, which equips each blockchain peer with its own master and shard servers. In this way, each blockchain peer can be considered as a cluster that distributes the transaction to shorten the processing time and reach the consensus finally. We implement Aeolus on Go-Ethereum to evaluate its feasibility, on a testbed including 132 cloud servers. Our system runs stably for more than 8 h under the workload of 190 000 000 real-world user transactions. Experimental results show the efficiency that Aeolus can achieve more than 100 000 transactions/s of blockchain transactions, which is 15.6 times the throughput of the original blockchain. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

The PoCh protocol is designed to be scalable and extensible, with a controllable conformance delay and low hardware and computation requirements. To reach a consensus, PoCh uses chance rather than computing power: 'if condition 1, I am a candidate; if condition 2, I am the miner.' During every consensus iteration, the condition 1 is updated, and a single miner is chosen using condition 2. Those conditions are randomized without the node generating any value and without assigning any weight to such value. The fault tolerance of PoCh is 5f/3 + 1, meaning that PoCh can successfully achieve consensus as long as more than 40% of nodes are functioning properly, compared to 50% in the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

1337	CRSM: Computation Reloading Driven by Spatial-Temporal Mobility in Edge-Assisted Automated Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems	Edge Computing, as an emerging computing mode, transfers computing capacity from the cloud center to the edge of new generation automation sensor networks. However, the surge in the number of sensor devices has resulted in the edge server overload. Fortunately, with the development of hardware technology, the computing capacity of sensor devices has improved. Therefore, we introduce a new concept of computation reloading, that is, resource-rich servers allocate tasks to sensor devices with stronger computing capacity. Most previous real-time EC researches have not considered sensor devices' higher spatial-temporal mobility, which results in continuous computation migration and high delay. In this article, we expose a computation reloading scheme driven by spatial-temporal mobility (CRSM), for single time slice and multiple time slices cases, computation tasks are allocated in advance by predicting sensor devices locations. The experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms other methods in terms of shorting industrial cyber-physical systems delays. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1338	Green Parallel Online Offloading for DSCI-Type Tasks in IoT-Edge Systems	In order to meet people's demands for intelligent and user-friendly Internet of Things (IoT) services, the amount of computation is increasing rapidly and the requirements of task delay are becoming increasingly more stringent. However, the constrained battery capacity of IoT devices greatly limits the user experience. Energy harvesting technologies enable green energy to provide continuous energy support for devices in the IoT environment. Together with the maturity of the mobile edge computing technology and the development of parallel computing, it provides a strong guarantee for the normal operation of resource-constrained IoT devices. In this article, we design a parallel offloading strategy based on Lyapunov optimization, which is conducive to efficiently finding the optimal decision for delay-sensitive and compute-intensive tasks. We establish a stochastic optimization problem on a discrete-time slot system and propose a green parallel online offloading algorithm (GPOOA). By decoupling the target problem three times, the joint optimization of green energy, task division factor, CPU frequency, and transmission power is realized. Experimental results demonstrate that under the constraints of strict task deadlines and limited server computing resources, GPOOA performs well in terms of system cost and task drop ratio, far superior to several existing offloading algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1339	Block Hunter: Federated Learning for Cyber Threat Hunting in Blockchain-Based IIoT Networks	Nowadays, blockchain-based technologies are being developed in various industries to improve data security. In the context of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a chain-based network is one of the most notable applications of blockchain technology. IIoT devices have become increasingly prevalent in our digital world, especially in support of developing smart factories. Although blockchain is a powerful tool, it is vulnerable to cyberattacks. Detecting anomalies in blockchain-based IIoT networks in smart factories is crucial in protecting networks and systems from unexpected attacks. In this article, we use federated learning to build a threat hunting framework called block hunter to automatically hunt for attacks in blockchain-based IIoT networks. Block hunter utilizes a cluster-based architecture for anomaly detection combined with several machine learning models in a federated environment. To the best of our knowledge, block hunter is the first federated threat hunting model in IIoT networks that identifies anomalous behavior while preserving privacy. Our results prove the efficiency of the block hunter in detecting anomalous activities with high accuracy and minimum required bandwidth. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1340	A New Cycle-consistent Adversarial Networks With Attention Mechanism for Surface Defect Classification With Small Samples	Surface defect detection is the essential process to ensure the quality of products. Surface defect classification (SDC) based on deep learning (DL) has shown its great potential. However, the well-trained SDC model usually requires large training data, and the small intraclass differences between the defect and normal samples also degrades the performance of SDC model. To overcome these drawbacks, this article proposed a new cycle-consistent adversarial networks with attention mechanism (AttenCGAN). First, AttenCGAN is used for synthesizing defect samples to enlarge the samples volume. Second, the attention mechanism is adopted for the feature enhancement by finding the discriminative parts of the samples and enlarging the differences among the samples. AttenCGAN is tested on KolektorSDD and DAGM2007 datasets, and its accuracies are 98.53% and 99.57% with only a few samples. The experiment results show that AttenCGAN outperforms other published SDC methods based on DL and machine learning, which validates its potential. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	5

1343	Privacy-Preserving Anomaly Detection in Cloud Manufacturing Via Federated Transformer	With the rapid development of cloud manufacturing, industrial production with edge computing as the core architecture has been greatly developed. However, edge devices often suffer from abnormalities and failures in industrial production. Therefore, detecting these abnormal situations timely and accurately is crucial for cloud manufacturing. As such, a straightforward solution is that the edge device uploads the data to the cloud for anomaly detection. However, Industry 4.0 puts forward higher requirements for data privacy and security so that it is unrealistic to upload data from edge devices directly to the cloud. Considering the abovementioned severe challenges, this article customizes a weakly supervised edge computing anomaly detection framework, i.e., federated learning-based transformer framework (FedAnomaly), to deal with the anomaly detection problem in cloud manufacturing. Specifically, we introduce federated learning (FL) framework that allows edge devices to train an anomaly detection model in collaboration with the cloud without compromising privacy. To boost the privacy performance of the framework, we add differential privacy noise to the uploaded features. To further improve the ability of edge devices to extract abnormal features, we use the transformer to extract the feature representation of abnormal data. In this context, we design a novel collaborative learning protocol to promote efficient collaboration between FL and transformer. Furthermore, extensive case studies on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time integrating FL and transformer to deal with anomaly detection problems in cloud manufacturing. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

This article proposes a priority-sensitive task offloading and resource allocation scheme in an IoV network, where vehicles periodically exchange beacon messages to inquire about available services and other important information necessary for making the offloading decisions. In the proposed methodology, the vehicles are stimulated to share their idle computation resources with the task vehicles, whereby a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on soft actor-critic is designed to classify the tasks based on priority and computation size of each task for optimally allocating the power. Furthermore, we also design deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed DDPG (TD3) algorithms for the considered framework. In particular, the algorithms work toward achieving the optimal policy for task offloading by maximizing the mean utility of the considered network. Extensive numerical results under different network conditions, along with comparison among the three algorithms, are presented to validate the feasibility of distributed reinforcement learning for task offloading in future IoV networks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

1347	Secure and Efficient Federated Learning for Smart Grid with Edge-Cloud Collaboration	With the prevalence of smart appliances, smart meters, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart grids, artificial intelligence (AI) built on the rich IoT big data enables various energy data analysis applications and brings intelligent and personalized energy services for users. In conventional AI of Things (AIoT) paradigms, a wealth of individual energy data distributed across users’ IoT devices needs to be migrated to a central storage (e.g., cloud or edge device) for knowledge extraction, which may impose severe privacy violation and data misuse risks. Federated learning, as an appealing privacy-preserving AI paradigm, enables energy data owners (EDOs) to cooperatively train a shared AI model without revealing the local energy data. Nevertheless, potential security and efficiency concerns still impede the deployment of federatedlearning-based AIoT services in smart grids due to the low-quality shared local models, non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data distributions, and unpredictable communication delays. In this article, we propose a secure and efficient federated-learning-enabled AIoT scheme for private energy data sharing in smart grids with edge-cloud collaboration. Specifically, we first introduce an edge-cloud-assisted federated learning framework for communication-efficient and privacy-preserving energy data sharing of users in smart grids. Then, by considering non-IID effects, we design a local data evaluation mechanism in federated learning and formulate two optimization problems for EDOs and energy service providers. Furthermore, due to the lack of knowledge of multidimensional user private information in practical scenarios, a two-layer deep reinforcement-learning-based incentive algorithm is developed to promote EDOs’ participation and high-quality model contribution. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively stimulate EDOs to share high-quality local model updates and improve the communication efficiency. © 2021 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	13
1348	A Self-Tuning Cyber-Attacks' Location Identification Approach for Critical Infrastructures	The integration of the communications network and the Internet of Things in today's critical infrastructures facilitates intelligent and online monitoring of these systems.

Flocking and cooperation with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play a vital role in industrial AIoT networks. In this article, we formulate the collision-free flocking problem of fixed-wing UAVs as a Markov decision process and solve it in the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Our method can deal with a variable number of followers by encoding the dynamic environmental state into a fixed-length embedding tensor. Specifically, each follower constructs a fixed-size local situation map that describes the collision risks with other followers nearby. The local situation maps are used by a proposed DRL algorithm to learn the collision-free flocking behavior. To further improve the learning efficiency, we design a reference-point-based action selection strategy and an adaptive mechanism. We compare the proposed MA2D3QN algorithm with several benchmark DRL algorithms through numerical simulation, and we verify its advantages in learning efficiency and performance. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of MA2D3QN in a semiphysical simulation experiment. © 2021 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1350	A Privacy-Enhanced Retrieval Technology for the Cloud-Assisted Internet of Things	In the cloud-assisted Internet of things (IoT), most of the data are sent to the cloud for storage and processing. Data privacy and security are extreme concerns since retrieving data from the cloud will yield privacy disclosure risk due to the cloud's openness. To this end, this article proposes PERT, a privacy-enhanced retrieval technology for cloud-assisted IoT. This architecture is designed through an implicit index maintained by edge servers and a hierarchical retrieval model that preserves data privacy by hiding the information of data transmission between the cloud and the edge servers. For the hierarchical retrieval model, we designed a data partition strategy. The edge server stores partial data. In this way, data privacy is preserved since the attacker must get the data maintained by both cloud and edge servers. The detailed performance analysis and extensive experiments have displayed the effectiveness of the technology for data privacy. It is tested that the architecture can efficiently and securely retrieve the stored data while the computation cost is reduced through operation downsizing. Compared with the benchmark cloud encrypted storage model, the time cost of this method is significantly reduced when the number of users is relatively large. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	26
1351	A Cloud-Assisted Reliable Trust Computing Scheme for Data Collection in Internet of Things	Large number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications with intelligent sensing devices (ISDs) are combined with cloud computing to collect and process data more efficiently. However, ISDs are vulnerable to various attacks. Compromised devices may maliciously provide unreliable data to the cloud, causing damage to IoT applications. Therefore, it is a critical issue to design an effective mechanism to ensure the security of data collection in cloud computing. In this article, a cloud-assisted reliable trust computing (CRTC) scheme is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs at low cost, providing high-quality data for IoT applications. The CRTC scheme mainly includes the following parts: First, a reliable approach of obtaining the real data of ISDs at a low cost is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs. In the proposed method, ISDs fits the forwarding packets information to form inspection information (II) with a small amount of data and then sends II to inspection nodes, effectively reducing the cost of routing II. Second, an effective method of trust computing is given to evaluate the trustworthiness of ISDs based on the data and II collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Then, the aggregators are selected from high-trust ISDs to ensure secure data collection. Third, to obtain more reliable trust at lower cost, a trajectory optimization algorithm for UAV is proposed to collect as much II as possible and reduce the moving distance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed CRTC scheme is superior to previous strategies in terms of the success rate of data collection, the speed of identifying the trust of ISDs, and the UAV's trajectory distance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4

While edge computing can provide immediate analysis of streaming data from Internet of Things devices, those devices lack computing capabilities to guarantee reasonable performance for time-critical applications. To alleviate this critical problem, the prevalent trend is to offload these data analytic tasks from the edge devices to the cloud. However, existing offloading approaches are static in nature as they are unable to adapt varying workload and network conditions. To handle these issues, we present a novel distributed and quality of services based multilevel queue traffic scheduling system that can undertake semiautomatic bandwidth slicing to process time-critical incoming traffic in the edge-cloud environments.

This evolution relies mainly on advanced digital technologies, including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), by deploying multiple IIoT devices within industrial systems. Such a setup increases the possibility of threats, especially with the emergence of IIoT botnets. This can provide attackers with more sophisticated tools to conduct devastating IIoT attacks. Besides, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are considered as powerful techniques to efficiently detect IIoT attacks. However, the centralized way in building learning models and the lack of up-to-date datasets that contain the main attacks are still ongoing challenges. In this context, multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and federated learning (FL) are two promising complementary technologies. MEC brings computing capabilities at the edge of the industrial systems, while FL leverages the edge resources to enable a privacy-aware collaborative learning, especially in multiindustrial systems context. In this article, we design a novel MEC-based framework to secure IIoT applications leveraging FL, called FedGame. Specifically, FedGame enables multiple MEC domains to collaborate securely to deal with an IIoT attack, while preserving the privacy of IIoT devices. Moreover, a noncooperative game is formulated on the top of FedGame, to enable MEC nodes acquiring the needed virtual resources from the centralized MEC orchestrator, to deal with each type of IIoT attacks. We evaluate FedGame using real-world IIoT attacks; the experimental results show not only the accuracy of FedGame against centralized ML/DL schemes while preserving the privacy of Industrial systems but also its efficiency in providing required MECs resources and, thus, dealing with IIoT attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3

Although the encryption technologies can ensure the confidentiality of communication data, the security of key becomes more important for devices in IIoT. Recently, some asymmetric group key agreement (AGKA) protocols have been proposed to negotiate a common encryption key for group members, and each group member holds its decryption key. However, the existing AGKA protocols fail to effectively control the access of agreement participants in IIoT. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose an AGKA protocol based on blockchain and attribute for IIoT. The proposed protocol not only realizes the access control of agreement participants but also realizes the automation of access control, the tamper resistance, and the nonrepudiation of the agreement process. The security and performance analysis of the proposed protocol show that it is more secure and effective compared with the existing AGKA protocols. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1366	A Hierarchical Training-Convolutional Neural Network for Imbalanced Fault Diagnosis in Complex Equipment	Complex equipment is important in industry and fault diagnosis is a key technology for maintenance. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a common manner for fault diagnosis. But due to the imbalanced data, it cannot be applied to complex equipment directly. Generally, CNNs require balanced data, and imbalanced data will mislead the models and ignore actual faults. In complex equipment, since fault occurs rarely, the fault data are imbalanced. This impedes the application of CNNs greatly. To overcome this problem, a hierarchical training-CNN is proposed in this article. The proposed method uses an effective number-resampling to balance fault data, which avoids invalid samples, and introduces a magnet-loss pretraining to address the overlap of features between different faults. Based on these improvements, the proposed method achieves good diagnosis performances with an average accuracy of 96.56%, and has been developed into a real-world case successfully with an accuracy of 94.28%. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1367	AcoPalm: Acoustical Palmprint-Based Noncontact Identity Authentication	Biometric sensing has become a widely concerned authentication technology. Existing image-based methods are susceptible to light conditions and have privacy exposure risks, while contact authentication methods are not conducive to epidemic prevention requirements in public places. In this article, we propose a palmprint-based identification system by collecting backscattered signals of the inaudible acoustic signals, namely AcoPalm. AcoPalm does not require special hardware and contact operation for user authentication. First, frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) on acoustic signals are designed to extract static contours and palmprint changes and to model the unique biological characteristics of the individual palm. Second, a palmprint authentication model based on PENN is proposed to achieve high-precision multiuser authentication without mass training data. Finally, the system performance is evaluated in multiple smartphones and three scenarios. The experimental results show that AcoPalm can resist replay attack and imitation attack, and the authentication accuracy can reach 96.22%. Furthermore, AcoPalm achieves satisfactory experience in availability and practicality. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1368	Blockchain-Enabled Multiparty Computation for Privacy Preserving and Public Audit in Industrial IoT	With the rapid increase of the industrial data and the development of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm, the efficiency and the quality of service of the emerging applications have been improved. However, the contradiction between data sharing and privacy preserving is still an obstacle in the IIoT. To this end, in this article, we propose a privacy-preserving and publicly auditable multiparty computation scheme for industrial data sharing and computing, which avoids privacy leakage and computation misbehavior by separating the data ownership, data use, and data verification. Using the blockchain technology, a transparent management platform is provided to recognize and trace the illegal data and computation behavior. Moreover, we integrate the noninteractive zero-knowledge proof in the multiparty interaction mechanism, wherein the verification of data consistency and computation validity is executed publicly on the blockchain. Finally, we implement experiment to evaluate the performance of the computation latency, communication overhead and the influence of encryption parameter, and the numerical results illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of our scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1369	EEGWaveNet: Multiscale CNN-Based Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction for EEG Seizure Detection	The detection of seizures in epileptic patients via Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential key to medical treatment. With the advances in deep learning, many approaches are proposed to tackle this problem. However, concerns such as performance, speed, and subject-independency should still be considered for practical application. Thus, we propose EEGWaveNet, a novel end-to-end multiscale convolutional neural network designed to address epileptic seizure detection. Our network utilizes trainable depth-wise convolutions as discriminative filters to simultaneously gather features from each EEG channel and separate the signal into multiscale resolution. Then, the spatial-temporal features are extracted from each scale for further classification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EEGWaveNet, we evaluate the model in three datasets: CHB-MIT, TUSZ, and BONN. From the results, EEGWaveNet's performance is comparable to other baseline methods in the subject-dependent approach and outperforms the others in subject-independent approaches. EEGWaveNet also has time complexity comparable to the compact EEGNet-8,2. Moreover, we transfer the model trained from the subject-independent approach and fine-tune it with a 1-h recording, significantly improving sensitivity and F1-score (Binary) compared to without fine-tuning. This article indicates the possibility of further developing this model and the fine-tuning methodology toward healthcare 5.0, where the AI aid clinicians in a manner of man-machine collaboration. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1370	Verifiable Keyword Search Supporting Sensitive Information Hiding for the Cloud-Based Healthcare Sharing System	With the integration of the healthcare system, Internet of Things, and cloud storage service, more and more medical institutions upload their electronic medical records (EMRs) to the cloud to reduce the local storage burden and realize data sharing among external researchers. To secure the sensitive information, EMRs usually should be encrypted before being stored on the cloud. However, the existing searchable encryption schemes that encrypt the entire EMRs can hide the sensitive information, but this results in the shared EMRs being unable to be used by researchers. In addition, if the queried and extracted EMRs are incorrect, it will lead to misdiagnosis and even endanger the patient's life. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, in this article, we propose a verifiable keyword search scheme supporting sensitive information hiding for the cloud-based healthcare sharing system. The sensitive information is encrypted, while other contents in EMR can be shared among users in this scheme. Doctors and researchers can quickly perform search operations based on keywords to extract the EMRs they require. This time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of attribute values in the record. But the sensitive information is hidden for the researchers. Furthermore, the correctness of EMRs can be verified when they are extracted from the cloud. This time complexity is max O(n ′),O(N′), where n′ is the number of query keywords and N′ is the number of the retrieved records. We expound the security and carry out experiments to estimate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

However, few studies have paid attention to design implicit interaction that users can directly manipulate physical circumstance without touch or specific gesture. This article proposes ReflectU, a novel reflection-based approach that leverages mirror reflection for a natural and implicit interactive method for remote control, i.e., user will be able to directly interact with physical circumstance just via the reflection of their bare hands. We compare its performance with that of other two generally known devices: Wii Remoter and Microsoft Kinect. Moreover, performance metrics of ReflectU are evaluated in real-life scenarios and provide evidence in convincing performance in both the tasks requiring instant targeting and trajectory control. Furthermore, ReflectU is reported by users to be the most intuitive and satisfactory approach among all three candidates in user studies. Future industrial applications of the reflection-base mirror approach are discussed. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

To this end, a deep learning approach based on the generative adversarial models (GAMs) is designed to not only have a prediction interval with high confidence level but also make the least bandwidth with the maximum possible information. Moreover, an evolving approach based on bat algorithm is proposed to help to train the GAM optimally.

1373	Enabling Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Borne Secure Communication With Classification Framework for Industry 5.0	The fifth industrial revolution (Industry 5.0) integrates humans and machines to satisfy the increasing customization demands of the manufacturing complexity using an optimized robotized manufacturing process. Industry 5.0 make use of collaborative robots (cobots) for optimizing productivity and ensuring safety. At the same time, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are predicted to be the main part of industry 5.0 in the forthcoming days. Regardless of high mobility and energy-limited UAVs for wireless communication as significant advantages, different issues are also existing in the UAV networks, such as security, reliability, etc. Several research works have focused on resolving security issues in UAV communication to support safety-critical applications. With this motivation, this article presents an artificial intelligence-based UAV-borne secure communication with classification (AIUAV-SCC) framework for industry 5.0 environment. The proposed AIUAV-SCC model involves two major phases namely image steganography-based secure communication and deep learning (DL)-based classification. At the initial stage, a new image steganography technique with multilevel discrete wavelet transformation, quantum bacterial colony optimization based optimal pixel selection, and encryption processes take place. Next, in the second stage, the Bayesian optimization (BO)-based SqueezeNet model is applied for the classification of securely received UAV images where the parameters in the SqueezeNet method are optimally tuned by the utilize of the BO technique. To validate the performance of the presented model, extensive simulations are applied using the UC Merced dataset (UCM) aerial dataset and the outcomes are investigated under several dimensions. The outcomes make sure the goodness of the presented model on test UCM aerial dataset over the compared methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	4
1374	A VMD and LSTM Based Hybrid Model of Load Forecasting for Power Grid Security	As the basis for the static security of the power grid, power load forecasting directly affects the safety of grid operation, the rationality of grid planning, and the economy of supply-demand balance. However, various factors lead to drastic changes in short-term power consumption, making the data more complex and thus more difficult to forecast. In response to this problem, a new hybrid model based on variational mode decomposition and long short-term memory with seasonal factors elimination and error correction is proposed in this article. Comprehensive case studies on four real-world load datasets from Singapore and the United States are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed hybrid model. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is significantly higher than that of the contrast models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	12
1375	A Scalable Two-Layer Blockchain System for Distributed Multicloud Storage in IIoT	Blockchain has been utilized to manage distributed multicloud storage in the industrial Internet of Things. Existing approaches commonly use trusted third-party servers or middlewares to search data allocation strategies and use blockchain to enhance security. However, finding a fair data allocation strategy is hard when the third-party brokers are manipulated. Moreover, the complex computing in generating blocks reduces efficiency and heavy communication cost in consensus leads to critical challenges to scalability. To address that, this article proposes a scalable two-layer blockchain system for distributed multi-cloud storage (STSM). We design a novel consensus mechanism called proof of storage allocation, which integrates data placement problems into leader selection to achieve fair strategy and high QoS of data storage. We also incorporate asynchronous consensus groups into the consensus process to enhance scalability. Extensive experiments verify that STSM gains high scalability and increases efficiency while achieving high QoS in distributed multicloud data allocation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1376	LM-CNN: A Cloud-Edge Collaborative Method for Adaptive Fault Diagnosis With Label Sampling Space Enlarging	In cloud manufacturing systems, fault diagnosis is essential for ensuring stable manufacturing processes. The most crucial performance indicators of fault diagnosis models are generalization and accuracy. An urgent problem is the lack and imbalance of fault data. To address this issue, in this article, most of existing approaches demand the label of faults as a priori knowledge and require extensive target fault data. These approaches may also ignore the heterogeneity of various equipment. We propose a cloud-edge collaborative method for adaptive fault diagnosis with label sampling space enlarging, named label-split multiple-inputs convolutional neural network, in cloud manufacturing. First, a multiattribute cooperative representation-based fault label sampling space enlarging approach is proposed to extend the variety of diagnosable faults. Besides, a multi-input multi-output data augmentation method with label-coupling weighted sampling is developed.

1377	Self-Attention-Based Machine Theory of Mind for Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Forecast	The popularization of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations has been threatening the distribution network's reliability and efficiency. The prediction of EV charging demand can benefit the optimization of the operation of energy-transportation nexus and improve social welfare toward a low carbon future. In this article, a short-term probabilistic charging demand forecast model is proposed to estimate the quantiles of future charging demand of a charging station 15 min ahead, i.e., the self-attention-based machine theory of mind (SAMToM). The SAMToM has considered both the users' historical charging habits (schedules) and the current trend of charging demand variation using the framework of machine theory of mind (MToM), and real-world-data-based case studies have verified its superiority in EV charging demand forecast over state-of-the-arts. Moreover, analyses show that the advantage of SAMToM lies in the following aspects. 1) The self-attention layers have mitigated the long-range forgetting in SAMToM. 2) The MToM architecture enables SAMToM to balance historical charging habits and current charging demand variation trends well. 3) Using a quantile forecast evaluation metric as the loss function, i.e., the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), enables SAMToM to aim directly at the highest quality of forecasted quantiles. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	
1378	An Edge Intelligent Blockchain-Based Reputation System for IIoT Data Ecosystem	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices generate and collect massive amounts of industrial data. Monetizing the flood of data generated by the IIoT devices has enabled the creation of the IIoT data ecosystem, where individuals and businesses may trade data. With the rapid expansion of the online data trading industry, the necessity for an edge intelligent reputation system is becoming increasingly important as more individuals and services connect online. In recent years, researchers have proposed blockchain-based reputation systems as a means of offering anonymity, security, transparency, and mutual trust for both providers and customers in Industry 4.0. Unfortunately, they focus on the decentralized reputation system with a single certificate authority, which creates the concern of a single point of failure (SPOF). Moreover, researchers paid little attention to the performance measures of these blockchain-based reputation systems to demonstrate their usability in a real IIoT data ecosystem. This article proposes a robust edge intelligent blockchain-based reputation system capable of avoiding failures by enhancing the Raft consensus mechanism. We provide extensive security analysis and simulation experiments to demonstrate the performance of the blockchain-based reputation system for the IIoT data ecosystem using different metrics, such as transaction throughput, latency, and resource consumption. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2

Combination of sensors, the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and big data analytics to enhance patient care can lower the healthcare costs. This will enable the patients with more secure, affordable, and rising medical services. Besides problems, such as resource-constrained IoT stuff, identity theft attacks, and malicious insiders, there is a need to address smart healthcare in big data and artificial intelligence using edge computing services. To fix these concerns, we are proposing a software-defined networking (SDN)-based security compliance structure for smart healthcare load migration systems. Toward this end, the use of SDN-IIoT technology for effective and real-time protection against security attacks is being explored by researchers and professionals. In our proposed framework, there are three domains and each domain has one virtual machine and various OpenFlow virtual switches. This scenario helps in migrating the heavily loaded domain healthcare data to the lightly loaded domain to make the domain balanced and prevent the migration from happening any type of security attacks. The RYU SDN controller is used to test the simulations and effectiveness of the performance obtained in the mininet after capturing the OpenFlow packets in Wireshark.

In addition, battery swapping could become an efficient energy-refueling means for electric vehicles (EVs). The quality-of-service aware battery swapping price determined by the battery swapping stations (BSSs) considers the interaction between AMoD fleet and BSSs, which is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem in this article. The interdependence between two systems is bridged by the swapping price that is both time-varying and location-varying. In the upper level, the swapping pricing is optimized to reflect the battery inventory so that the EV fleet could be navigated for the BSS strategically, the queue time would be reduced consequently. BSS operator optimizes swapping pricing scheme and battery charging management with the objective of minimizing the cost induced by the queue process and battery charging. In the lower level, a unified network flow model incorporating queue procedure in BSSs is proposed in order to characterize the operational decision of AMoD fleet. The AMoD operator develops fleet scheduling strategies with the objective of maximizing the AMoD system profit.

1382	FDI Attack Detection at the Edge of Smart Grids Based on Classification of Predicted Residuals	The introduction of information and communication technologies makes network environments increasingly open, leaving smart-grid control systems incredibly vulnerable to malicious attacks. False data injection (FDI) attacks stealthily tamper with measurement data, resulting in erroneous decisions made by the control center that greatly influence the normal operation of the power system. By taking advantage of real-time data acquisition with edge computing, in this article, we propose a scheme based on classification of predicted residuals (CPRs) for the FDI attack detection. The CPR scheme first predicts the acquired measurement data at the edge of the sensing network via developing an accurate prediction model. Followed the novel real-time classification method under the edge devices supporting, it classifies the predicted residuals independent of the false data to enhance the detection accuracy. Through these two steps, the detection rate of FDI attacks is greatly improved. The proposed scheme is validated in a real microgrid testbed. Experimental results show that the CPR scheme performs well in detecting FDI attacks and remains sensitive in injection attack probability and magnitude. The detection scheme even has effectiveness at low injection attack probability and magnitude (5% and 0.018 per thousand, respectively). Furthermore, it also proves that the proposed scheme has applicability in high real-time requirements at the edge of smart grids. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

The IoMT has numerous benefits; however, the security issue still persists as a challenge. The lack of security awareness among novice IoMT users and the risk of several intermediary attacks for accessing health information severely endanger the use of IoMT.

1385	FairHealth: Long-Term Proportional Fairness-Driven 5G Edge Healthcare in Internet of Medical Things	Recently, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) could offload healthcare services to 5G edge computing for low latency. However, some existing works assumed altruistic patients will sacrifice quality of service for the global optimum. For priority-aware and deadline-sensitive healthcare, this sufficient and simplified assumption will undermine the engagement enthusiasm, i.e., unfairness. To address this issue, we propose a long-term proportional fairness-driven 5G edge healthcare, i.e., FairHealth. First, we establish a long-term Nash bargaining game to model the service offloading, considering the stochastic demand and dynamic environment. We then design a Lyapunov-based proportional-fairness resource scheduling algorithm, which decouples the long-term fairness problem into single-slot subproblems, realizing a tradeoff between service stability and fairness. Moreover, we propose a block-coordinate descent method to iteratively solve nonconvex fair subproblems. Simulation results show that our scheme can improve 74.44% of the fairness index (i.e., Nash product), compared with the classic global time-optimal scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1386	RNS-Based Adaptive Compression Scheme for the Block Data in the Blockchain for IIoT	The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the essential component of Industry 4.0. Blockchain is a promising technology for secure data sharing and trustable cooperation between IIoT devices. However, the ever-growing transaction records make it difficult for the storage-limited IIoT devices to join the blockchain network. In this article, an adaptive compression scheme is proposed to decrease the storage volume on each node. In the scheme, the block body is compressed by representing the included transactions as their remainders stored in the distributed nodes. The original transaction could be recovered based on the Chinese remainder theorem. In particular, each node adapts its compression ratio according to its storage resource. The nodes storing more data have advantages in transaction recovery, introducing an incentive mechanism for efficient storage utilization. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a high compression ratio with good service availability. The proposed scheme dramatically lowers the threshold for IIoT devices to join the blockchain network, which is important for the large-scale application of blockchain in Industry 4.0. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1387	Robust Synchronized Data Acquisition for Biometric Authentication	Owing to its unique, concealment and easy customization by combining different wrist and hand gestures, high-density surface electromyogram (HD-sEMG) is recognized as a potential solution to the next generation biometric authentication, which usually adopts a wireless body sensor network (BSN) to acquire the multi-channel HD-sEMG biosignals from distributed electrode arrays. For more accurate and reliable classification, biometric authentication requires the distributed biosignals to be sampled simultaneously and be well aligned, which means that the sampling jitters among the arrays need to be tiny. To synchronize data sampling clocks of a cluster of BSN nodes for biometric authentication, this article modifies the packet-coupled oscillators protocol by using a dynamic controller (D-PkCOs). This protocol only involves one-way single packet exchange, which reduces the communication overhead significantly. For the purpose of maintaining precise sampling of these BSN nodes subject to drifting clock frequency and varying delays, the dynamic controller is designed via the H∞ robust method, and it is proved that all the BSN nodes' sampling jitters are bounded. The experimental results demonstrate that the D-PkCOs protocol can keep the sampling jitters less than a microsecond in a 10-node IEEE 802.15.4 network. The application of D-PkCOs to the BSN shows that the HD-sEMG signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio is obtained, which leads to better gesture classification performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

To tackle these constraints, a secure privacy-preserving bilateral access control scheme with fine granularity (PBAC-FG) is proposed in this article. Our PBAC-FG exploits fine-grained access control and matchmaking encryption technologies to ensure both participants (e.g., patients and healthcare providers) can specify their respective fine-grained access control over the encrypted health data, such that only authorized counterparts can efficiently access the health data. Besides, the correct rigorous security proofs are indicated to verify that our PBAC-FG is indeed secure.

1390	CroApp: A CNN-Based Resource Optimization Approach in Edge Computing Environment	With the emergence of various convolutional neural network (CNN)-based applications and the rapid growth of CNN model scale, the resource-constricted end devices can hardly deploy CNN-based applications. Current work optimizes the CNN model on edge servers and deploys the optimized model on devices in an edge computing environment. However, most of them only optimize the resource consumption within or across models solely, whereas neglecting the other side. In this article, we propose a novel CNN-based resource optimization approach (CroApp) that not only optimizes the resource consumption within the CNN model but also pays attention to resource optimization across the applications. Specifically, we adopt model compression as the 'inner-model' optimization method, as well as computation sharing as the 'intermodel' optimization method. First, during 'inner-model' optimization, the CroApp prunes unnecessary parameters within the model on edge servers to reduce the scale of the model. Then, during 'intermodel' optimization, the CroApp trains a set of shareable models based on the pruned model and sends these shareable models to end devices. Finally, the CroApp adaptively adjusts the shared models to reduce resource consumption. The experimental results show that the CroApp outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of resource reduction, scalability, and application performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

This is done by bypassing upper authentication protocols and supporting small data transmission during initial access, which, however, causes serious security breaches in IIoT device authentication. To solve this, in this article propose a secure cross-layer authentication framework based on quantum walk on circles. The system performs random hash coding on multidomain physical-layer resources to encode and decode device identifiers securely, while using a quantum walk based privacy-preserving protocol to maintain code privacy at arbitrary high level, being controlled by the number of occupied physical resources. The upper bound of decoding errors is derived and a nonconvex integer programming problem of minimizing the bound is formulated to characterize the security performance. The space of one-time keys for encryption is also derived that show how high privacy and scalability advantage is maintained against classical and quantum computers. Finally, we derive novel expressions of failure probability of this new authentication system and numerically show that our scheme can bring ultrahigh level of security and privacy protection with low latency despite attack. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	18

However, research works have shown that, by training the local model on crafted poisoning samples malicious participants can jeopardize the functionalities of the global model. In this article, we propose a robust federated learning method, named RobustFL, in IIoT systems to defend against poisoning attacks. The main idea is that we conduct an adversarial training framework, in which an extra logits-based predictive model is built at the server-side to predict which participant a given logit belongs to. Meanwhile, the federated model is adversarially trained to prevent this predictive behavior, thus mitigating the poisoning attack influences. We evaluate the poisoning attack and our defense method on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of high accuracy and efficiency in defending against poisoning attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1393	CeCO: Cost-Efficient Computation Offloading of IoT Applications in Green Industrial Fog Networks	Fog computing is one of the promising technology that could reduce the execution cost and energy consumption of smart industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices via a strategy called offloading. However, designing an intelligent offloading strategy for large-scale industrial applications becomes challenging. To address this issue, in this article, we design a novel fog federation, a computation offloading framework for industrial networks called cost-efficient computation offloading (CeCO), where a master fog controller regulates the network and distributes the IIoT data among the fog devices. In particular, we design our cost optimization function as the sum of weighted energy-delay cost of IIoT devices while reaching several constraints. To determine this optimization problem, we first design a frequency control mechanism for the IIoT devices. Then, we introduce a controller-based device adaptation strategy and a policy-based reinforcement learning technique for efficiently controlling emergency-based service demands and accordingly route them toward the fog devices following the shortest path. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CeCO strategy then the baseline algorithms while maintaining the same and even better cost utilization and performance maximization upto 13%-18% for industrial applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	3
1394	FCFusion: Fractal Componentwise Modeling With Group Sparsity for Medical Image Fusion	Multimodal image fusion is the process of combing relevant biological information that can be used for automated industrial application. In this article, we present a novel framework combining fractal constraint with group sparsity to achieve the optimal fusion quality. First, we adopt the idea of patch division and componentwise separation to perceive the fractal characteristics across multimodality sources. Then, to preserve the spatial information against the redundancy of component-entanglement, the group sparsity is proposed. A dual variable weighting rule is inherently embedded to mitigate the overfitting across the component penalty. Furthermore, the alternating direction method of multipliers is conducted to the proposed model optimization. The experiments show that our model has a better performance in quantitative visual quality and qualitative evaluation analysis. Finally, a real segmentation application of positron emission tomography/computed tomography image fusion proves the effectiveness of our algorithm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1395	Class-Imbalance Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Decentralized Fault Diagnosis With Biometric Authentication	Privacy protection as a major concern of the industrial big data enabling entities makes the massive safety-critical operation data of a wind turbine unable to exert its great value because of the threat of privacy leakage. How to improve the diagnostic accuracy of decentralized machines without data transfer remains an open issue; especially these machines are almost accompanied by skewed class distribution in the real industries. In this study, a class-imbalanced privacy-preserving federated learning framework for the fault diagnosis of a decentralized wind turbine is proposed. Specifically, a biometric authentication technique is first employed to ensure that only legitimate entities can access private data and defend against malicious attacks. Then, the federated learning with two privacy-enhancing techniques enables high potential privacy and security in low-trust systems. Then, a solely gradient-based self-monitor scheme is integrated to acknowledge the global imbalance information for class-imbalanced fault diagnosis. We leverage a real-world industrial wind turbine dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. By comparison with five state-of-the-art approaches and two nonparametric tests, the superiority of the proposed framework in imbalanced classification is ascertained. An ablation study indicates that the proposed framework can maintain high diagnostic performance while enhancing privacy protection. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2
1396	Pattern Recognition of Barely Visible Impact Damage in Carbon Composites Using Pulsed Thermography	This article proposes a novel framework to characterize the morphological pattern of barely visible impact damage using machine learning. Initially, a sequence of image processing methods is introduced to extract the damage contour, which is then described by a Fourier descriptor-based filter. The uncertainty associated with the damage contour under the same impact energy level is then investigated. A variety of geometric features of the contour are extracted to develop an artificial intelligence model, which effectively groups the tested 100 samples impacted by 5 different impact energy levels with an accuracy of 96%. Predictive polynomial models are finally established to link the impact energy to the three selected features. It is found that the major axis length of the damage has the best prediction performance, with an R2 value up to 0.97. Additionally, impact damage caused by low energy exhibits higher uncertainty than that of high energy, indicating lower predictability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1397	A Privacy-Preserving Proximity Testing Using Private Set Intersection for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks	Proximity testing technologies have been of increasing importance in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), especially in location-based services. However, there exist several known challenges in most existing proximity testing methods. For instance, during proximity testing, how to protect the location privacy of users, guarantee the fairness trait of both communication parties, and reduce computational costs is challenging. In this article, we present an efficient privacy-preserving proximity testing scheme using private set intersection (PSI) and differential privacy. In our design, a Chebyshev-based PSI is constructed to achieve location privacy with low energy consumption during the proximity testing process. Furthermore, geo-indistinguishability is employed in our scheme to generate virtual points as inputs set of PSI, which further protects the location privacy from exposure and provides resistance to collusion attacks. Fairness requirement is alsosatisfied in our scheme. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme achieves good efficiency and is suitable for VANETs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1398	Towards Prediction Constraints: A Novel Domain Adaptation Method for Machine Fault Diagnosis	Domain adaptation technologies have been extensively explored and successfully applied to machine fault diagnosis, aiming to address problems that target data are unlabeled and have a certain distribution bias with source data. Nonetheless, existing fault diagnosis methods mainly explore feature-level alignment strategies to reduce domain discrepancies, which not only fails to directly ascertain the relationship between the target output and domain deviation, but also cannot guarantee accurate diagnosis results (i.e., learning class-discriminative features) when only relying on feature adaptation. In light of these issues, a more intuitive and effective domain adaptation method is developed for intelligent diagnosis of machinery in this article, in which the minimum class confusion and maximum nuclear norm-based target prediction constraints are simultaneously designed to promote learning reliable domain-invariant and discriminative features for accurate fault diagnosis. We conduct extensive experiments based on two different mechanical systems to evaluate the proposed method. Comprehensive results and discussions demonstrate the promising performance of our approach. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1399	Understanding Human Reactions Looking at Facial Microexpressions With an Event Camera	With the establishment of Industry 4.0, machines are now required to interact with workers. By observing biometrics they can assess if humans are authorized, or mentally and physically fit to work. Understanding body language, makes human-machine interaction more natural, secure, and effective. Nonetheless, traditional cameras have limitations; low frame rate and dynamic range hinder a comprehensive human understanding. This poses a challenge, since faces undergo frequent instantaneous microexpressions. In addition, this is privacy-sensitive information that must be protected. We propose to model expressions with event cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors that have found application within the Industry 4.0 scope. They capture motion at millisecond rates and work under challenging conditions like low illumination and highly dynamic scenes. Such cameras are also privacy-preserving, making them extremely interesting for industry. We show that using event cameras, we can understand human reactions by only observing facial expressions. Comparison with red-green-blue (RGB)-based modeling demonstrates improved effectiveness and robustness. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

1401	Correlation Aware Scheduling for Edge-Enabled Industrial Internet of Things	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has attracted increasing attention for improving the efficiency of manufacturing. Plenty of computation-intensive and latency-sensitive applications are required by IIoT networks, which pose significant challenges for the computation capacities of IIoT networks. To address these challenges, Edge-enabled Industrial Internet of Things (E-IIoT) emerges. Edge devices located at the edge of IIoT networks enlarge computation capacities of IIoT networks and improve their efficiency accordingly. How to schedule computation resources wisely is a major problem in E-IIoT networks. Since IIoT devices in an E-IIoT network monitor the industrial site collaboratively, tasks for processing sensory data collected by them are correlated accordingly. That means, scheduling highly correlated tasks to be processed at the same device can improve computation efficiency. Inspired by this fact, we propose a correlation aware scheduling (CAS) algorithm for E-IIoT networks in this article. In specific, computation model decision and processing order decision are made by considering computation resources of devices and correlations among tasks in the algorithm to minimize latency of E-IIoT networks. The NP-hardness of correlation aware latency minimization scheduling problem in E-IIoT networks is first proved. Theoretical analysis on approximation ratio of the CAS algorithm is provided, and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing latency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1402	Relation and Entropy Weight-Aware Knowledge Graph Embedding for Cloud Manufacturing	Cloud manufacturing has emerged as a service-oriented paradigm, in which knowledge graphs (KGs) play a crucial role in enabling modularization and on-demand servitization by converting unstructured resources into a structured graph representation and factual knowledge for manufacturing tasks. KG embedding converts entities and relations into a low-dimensional space while expressing rich semantics of high-dimensional KGs. Existing works just focus on translating relations surrounding the nodes of graphs, while ignoring the applicability for modeling and inferring multiple relation patterns in the manufacturing context. Furthermore, the relative importance of complex manufacturing relations among different dimensions in embedded procedures has been ignored, leading to unclear representation learning of complex relations and entities in KGs. To overcome this issue, in this article, a novel relation and entropy weight-aware embedding model is proposed, named TransCE. TransCE performs coordinated transformations in vector space by normalizing the distance to integrate coordination. An entropy-based weighting method is also proposed to represent complex relations and entities surrounding the edges of graph embedding and assign the weighted value of relations to support the score function. Extended experiments are performed on several datasets, and a manufacturing indicates that TransCE shows remarkable improvement relative to baseline models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

This article introduces a side chain consensus-based decentralized autonomous vehicle group formation method in a highway scene. First, we side chain consensus to describe states of autonomous vehicles. Then, we give decentralized autonomous vehicle group formation and maintenance methods based on side chain consensus. Finally, we conduct simulations to evaluate the quality of side chain consensus and stability of vehicle groups, which shows that our method has better properties in the balance of computing tasks, information symmetry, and stability than existing methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1404	Data-Driven Adaptive Virtual Metrology for Yield Prediction in Multibatch Wafers	Virtual metrology (VM) is widely used for yield management and control in semiconductor manufacturing owing to its high real-time inspection, low cost, and convenient maintenance. However, the multimodal characteristics of batch processes are ignored in the existing yield VM models. The adaptive multimodal division and modal sample imbalance have also not been considered. Therefore, a data-driven adaptive VM model based on the Gath-Geva fuzzy clustering (GGFC) and multitask learning deep belief network (MLDBN) is proposed to solve the problems above. First, the GGFC model is designed to realize the feature extraction of the batch direction and the modal division of the time and variable directions. Second, the partition coefficient and classification entropy indexes are designed to determine the modal categories automatically and establish the SMOTE model to deal with the imbalance of multimodal samples. Third, the local features of multimodal are extracted by the designed MLDBN models. After that, the batch direction features and the multi-features extracted from multimodal are used as the improved MLDBN parameters to realize the fusion prediction. Finally, experiments are carried out by the accurate industrial data from a multibatch wafer fabrication process. The efforts show that the proposed VM model presents better performances in the result of different indicators and has higher accuracy and robustness than the traditional models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1405	Distributed Real-Time Scheduling in Cloud Manufacturing by Deep Reinforcement Learning	With the extensive application of automated guided vehicles, real-time production scheduling considering logistics services in cloud manufacturing (CM) becomes an urgent problem. Thus, this study focuses on the distributed real-time scheduling (DRTS) of multiple services to respond to dynamic and customized orders. First, a DRTS framework with cloud-edge collaboration is proposed to improve performance and satisfy responsiveness, where distributed actors and one centralized learner are deployed in the edge and cloud layer, respectively. And, the DRTS problem is modeled as a semi-Markov decision process, where the processing services sequencing and logistics services assignment are considered simultaneously. Then, we developed a distributed dueling deep Q network (D3QN) with cloud-edge collaboration to optimize the weighted tardiness of jobs. The experimental results show that the proposed D3QN obtains lower weighted tardiness and shorter flow-time than other state-of-the-art algorithms. It indicates the proposed DRTS method has significant potential to provide efficient real-time decision-making in CM. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1

1407	A Multilateral Transactive Energy Framework of Hybrid Charging Stations for Low-Carbon Energy-Transport Nexus	This article proposes a multilateral multienergy trading framework for synergetic hydrogen (H2) and electricity transactions among renewable-dominated hybrid charging stations (HCSs). In this framework, each autonomous HCS with various renewable energy resource (RES) endowment can harvest local renewables for internal green H2 and electricity generation to simultaneously meet demands of electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen-powered vehicles (HVs) from the transportation network. The surplus electricity/H2 production of the HCS is accommodated by external multilateral transactions to increase the additional profit. Besides, each HCS is modeled as a sustainable energy hub, and multiple hubs with multienergy transactions contribute toward a low-carbon energy-transport nexus. A partial differential equation model based on fluid dynamic theory is formed to capture the temporal and spatial dynamics of traffic flows for estimating the EV/HV loads at HCSs. Furthermore, a distributed multilateral pricing algorithm is developed to iteratively derive the optimal prices and quantities for transactive electricity and H2. Comparative studies corroborate the superiority of the proposed methodology on economic merits and RES accommodation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
1408	On the Impact of Multimodal and Multisensor Biometrics in Smart Factories	Smart factories are fostered by integrating intelligent systems and ICT technologies. The role they play is crucial in the spread of Industry 4.0 and the economic growth of developed countries. Smart factories can be empowered by using several sensors aimed at making them more and more 'smart.' Unfortunately, work accidents are still very common resulting in human losses and permanent injuries. This makes it urgent and key to implementing security and safety measures also in the context of a smart factory. In this article, a novel framework for supporting smart devices in a smart factory, using multiple sensors to monitor different biometric features, both physical and behavioral is proposed. Thanks to the fusion of several biometric traits with the support of machine learning technologies working together with different kinds of sensors, it is possible to guarantee three fundamental aspects within the interaction between an operator of a smart device and the device itself: continuous authentication (i.e., continuous face recognition), drowsiness detection, and liveness detection. With the application of the proposed framework, it is possible to significantly improve the safety of operators avoiding fatal accidents for them. Experiments made using COTS-hardware showed that the authors' idea is easy to implement in a large-scale smart factory and further improves the spread of Industry 4.0. © 2005-2012 IEEE.	2022	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	1
